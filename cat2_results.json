On the other hand, the mass accretion rate favoured by ADAF is 10-20 times smaller than that favoured by the hydrodynamical simulation based on Bondi capture. If the latter were adopted, the predicted radio flux would significantly exceed the observation. A similar situation exists in the case of nearby giant ellipticals, where the canonical ADAF model - the widely assumed standard model for these sources - also significantly overpredicts the radio flux.

We also include X-rays from point sources associated with galaxies in the simulation, and we make maps of the angular distribution of the emission. Although much of the X-ray luminous gas has a filamentary structure, the filaments are not evident in the simulated maps because of projection effects.

A cross-correlation analysis of the XRB against nearby galaxies taken from a simulated redshift survey also yields a strong signal from the IGM. Our conclusions about the soft background intensity differ from those of some recent papers that have argued that the expected emission from gas in galaxy, group, and cluster halos would exceed the observed background unless much of the gas is expelled by supernova feedback.

In agreement with theoretical expectations and earlier results we found significant differences between the spatial distributions of low (LMXB) and high (HMXB) mass X-ray binaries.

Some uncertainty remains regarding the origin of the UV excess from the compact component known as P2. In our earlier analysis, we developed a unified picture for the broadband spectrum of this source and concluded that M31* could be understood on the basis of the accretion model for Sgr A* at the Galactic center, although with several crucial differences. Contrary to the ``standard'' picture in which the infalling plasma attains temperatures in excess of 10<SUP>10</SUP> K near the event horizon, the best-fit model for M31*, under the assumption that the UV radiation is in fact produced by this source, appears to correspond to a cool-branch solution arising from strong line cooling inside the capture radius.

We show that this level of sophistication reproduces the currently available multiwavelength observations very well.

We use GASOLINE, a version of the code PKDGRAV that includes a smoothed particle hydrodynamics description of hydrodynamics to simulate the formation of four haloes with virial temperatures in the range 0.5 〈~T〈~ 8 keV. These simulations resolve the structure and properties of the ICM down to a small fraction of the virial radius, R<SUB>vir</SUB>. At our resolution X-ray luminosities, L<SUB>X</SUB>, of runs with gravitational heating only are in good agreement with analytical predictions, which assume a universal profile for CDM haloes, over almost two orders of magnitude in mass. For each simulated structure, non-gravitational heating of the ICM is implemented in two different ways: (i) by imposing a minimum-entropy floor, S<SUB>fl</SUB>, at a given redshift, which we take in the range 1〈=z〈= 5; (ii) by gradually heating gas within collapsed regions, proportionally to the supernova rate expected from semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation in haloes having mass equal to that of the simulated systems. Our main results are the following. (i) An extra heating energy E<SUB>h</SUB>〉~ 1 keV per gas particle within R<SUB>vir</SUB> at z= 0 is required to reproduce the observed L<SUB>X</SUB>-T relation, independent of whether it is provided in an impulsive way to create an entropy floor S<SUB>fl</SUB>= 50-100 keV cm<SUP>2</SUP>, or is modulated in redshift according to the star formation rate; our supernova (SN) feedback recipe provides at most E<SUB>h</SUB>~= 1/3 keV particle<SUP>-1</SUP> and, therefore, its effect on the L<SUB>X</SUB>-T relation is too small to account for the observed L<SUB>X</SUB>-T relation. (ii) The required heating implies, in small groups with T~ 0.5 keV, a baryon fraction as low as 〈~40 per cent of the cosmic value at R<SUB>vir</SUB>/2 this fraction increases to about 80 per cent for a T~= 3 keV cluster. (iii) Temperature profiles are almost scale-free across the whole explored mass range, with T decreasing by a factor of 3 at the virial radius. (iv) The mass-temperature relation is almost unaffected by non-gravitational heating and follows quite closely the M~T<SUP>3/2</SUP> scaling; however, when compared with data on the M<SUB>500</SUB>-T<SUB>ew</SUB> relation, it has a ~40 per cent higher normalization. This discrepancy is independent of the heating scheme adopted. The inclusion of cooling in a run of a small group steepens the central profile of the potential well while removing gas from the diffuse phase. This has the effects of increasing T<SUB>ew</SUB> by ~30 per cent, possibly reconciling the simulated and the observed M<SUB>500</SUB>-T<SUB>ew</SUB> relations, and of decreasing L<SUB>X</SUB> by ~40 per cent. However, in spite of the inclusion of SN feedback energy, almost 40 per cent of the gas drops out from the hot diffuse phase, in excess of current observational estimates of the number of cold baryons in galaxy systems.

The existence of such sharp gradients can be used to put interesting constraints on the physics of the intracluster medium (ICM) if their mechanism and longevity are well understood. Here, we present results of a search for cold fronts in high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters in cold dark matter models. We show that sharp gradients with properties similar to those of observed cold fronts naturally arise in cluster mergers when the shocks heat gas surrounding the merging subcluster, while its dense core remains relatively cold. The compression induced by supersonic motions and shock heating during the merger enhance the amplitude of gas density and temperature gradients across the front. Our results indicate that cold fronts are nonequilibrium transient phenomena and can be observed for a period of less than a billion years. We show that the velocity and density fields of gas surrounding the cold front can be very irregular, which would complicate analyses aiming to put constraints on the physical conditions of the ICM in the vicinity of the front.","keyword":["Cosmology: Theory","Galaxies: Clusters: General","Instabilities- Galaxies: Intergalactic Medium","Methods: Numerical","X-Rays: Galaxies: Clusters","Astrophysics"]}]}}

Over 95% of the ultraviolet and Hα photons associated with the starburst are emerging from regions cloaked in keV gas with very short cooling times (~100 Myr), as would be expected from star formation fueled by cooling condensations in the intracluster medium.

Although supernova explosions associated with the starburst may be able to retard cooling in the inner 10 kpc of the cluster by ~18% or so, they are incapable of maintaining the cooling gas at keV temperatures. Therefore, it is plausible that the star formation in A1068 is being fueled by the cooling intracluster medium.

Minimal cooling is distinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from any direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica such as hyperons, Bose condensates, or deconfined quarks. Within the minimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a four parameter family involving the equation of state (including various compositional possibilities) of dense matter, superfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star envelope, and the mass of the neutron star. The consequences of minimal cooling are explored through extensive variations of these parameters.

The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR J0205+6449 (in the supernova remnant 3C 58) and RX J0007.0+7302 (in CTA 1) are indicative of the occurrence of some enhanced neutrino emission beyond the minimal scenario.","keyword":["Dense Matter","Equation of State","Neutrinos","Stars: Neutron","Astrophysics","Nuclear Theory"]}]}}

For the deep fields, we supplement the spectroscopic redshifts with photometric redshifts to assess where the unidentified sources are likely to lie. We find that the median redshifts are fairly constant with X-ray flux at z~1.We classify the optical spectra and measure the FWHM line widths. Most of the broad-line AGNs show essentially no visible absorption in X-rays, whereas the sources without broad lines (FWHM〈2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> ``optically narrow'' AGNs) show a wide range of absorbing column densities. We determine hard X-ray luminosity functions for all spectral types with L<SUB>X</SUB>〉=10<SUP>42</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> and for broad-line AGNs alone. At z〈1.2, both are well described by pure luminosity evolution, with L<SUB>*</SUB> evolving as (1+z)<SUP>3.2+/-0.8</SUP> for all spectral types and as (1+z)<SUP>3.0+/-1.0</SUP> for broad-line AGNs alone. Thus, all AGNs drop in luminosity by almost an order of magnitude over this redshift range. We show that this observed drop is due to AGN downsizing rather than to an evolution in the accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes.We directly compare our broad-line AGN hard X-ray luminosity functions with the optical QSO luminosity functions and find that at the bright end they agree extremely well at all redshifts. However, the optical QSO luminosity functions do not probe faint enough to see the downturn in the broad-line AGN hard X-ray luminosity functions and even appear to be missing some sources at the lowest luminosities they probe.We find that broad-line AGNs dominate the number densities at the higher X-ray luminosities, while optically narrow AGNs dominate at the lower X-ray luminosities. We rule out galaxy dilution as a partial explanation for this effect by measuring the nuclear UV/optical properties of the Chandra sources using the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys GOODS-North data. The UV/optical nuclei of the optically narrow AGNs are much weaker than expected if the optically narrow AGNs were similar to the broad-line AGNs. We therefore postulate the need for a luminosity-dependent unified model. An alternative possibility is that the broad-line AGNs and the optically narrow AGNs are intrinsically different source populations. We cover both interpretations by constructing composite spectral energy distributions-including long-wavelength data from the mid-infrared to the submillimeter-by spectral type and by X-ray luminosity. We use these spectral energy distributions to infer the bolometric corrections (from hard X-ray luminosities to bolometric luminosities) needed to map the accretion history.We determine the accreted supermassive black hole mass density for all spectral types and for broad-line AGNs alone, using the observed evolution of the hard X-ray energy density production rate and our inferred bolometric corrections. We find that only about one-half to one-quarter of the supermassive black hole mass density was fabricated in broad-line AGNs. Using either recent optical QSO luminosity function determinations or our broad-line AGN hard X-ray luminosity function determinations, we measure an accreted supermassive black hole mass density that is a factor of almost 2 lower than that measured by previous work, assuming ∊=0.1. This leaves room for obscured accretion when compared with the local supermassive black hole mass density. In fact, we find reasonable agreement between the accreted supermassive black hole mass density from all spectral types and the local supermassive black hole mass density, assuming ∊~0.1-0.2. However, there is little room for further obscured sources or for low-efficiency accretion periods.Based in part on data obtained at the W. M.

Approximately 70% of ~140 proplyds were detected as X-ray sources in the 838 ks COUP observation of the ONC, including ~25% of proplyds that do not display central stars in HST imaging. In near-infrared imaging, the detection rate of proplyd central stars is 〉90%. Many proplyds display near-infrared excesses, suggesting disk accretion is ongoing onto the central, PMS stars. About 50% of circumstellar disks that are detected in absorption in HST imaging contain X-ray sources. For these sources, we find that X-ray absorbing column and apparent disk inclination are well correlated, providing insight into the disk scale heights and metal abundances of UV- and X-ray-irradiated protoplanetary disks.

The planet's polar auroral zones and its disk are both powerful sources of X-ray emission. Chandra observations revealed X-ray emission from the Io plasma torus and from the Galilean moons Io, Europa, and possibly Ganymede. The emission from the moons is due to bombardment of their surfaces by highly energetic magnetospheric protons, and oxygen and sulfur ions. These ions excite atoms in their surfaces leading to fluorescent X-ray emission lines. These lines are produced against an intense background continuum, including bremsstrahlung radiation from surface interactions of primary magnetospheric and secondary electrons. Although the X-ray emission from the Galilean moons is faint when observed from Earth orbit, an imaging X-ray spectrometer in orbit around one or more of these moons, operating from 200 eV to 8 keV with 150 eV energy resolution, would provide a detailed mapping of the elemental composition in their surfaces. Surface resolution of 40 m for small features could be achieved in a 100-km orbit around one moon while also remotely imaging surfaces of other moons and Jupiter's upper atmosphere at maximum regional resolutions of hundreds of kilometers. Due to its relatively more benign magnetospheric radiation environment, its intrinsic interest as the largest moon in the Solar System, and its mini-magnetosphere, Ganymede would be the ideal orbital location for long-term observational studies of the jovian system.

In PaperI, we presented in detail the data reduction and analysis of the individual galaxies. For the unresolved X-ray sources, we find the following: point sources are in general located close to bright HII regions, rims of superbubbles or young stellar clusters. The number of X-ray point sources appears to be a function of the current star formation (SF) rate and the blue luminosity of the hosts. Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are only found in those dwarf galaxies that are currently interacting. The power-law (PL) index of the combined cumulative X-ray point-source luminosity function is α= 0.24 +/- 0.06, shallower than that of more massive starburst galaxies (α= 0.4 -0.8) and of non-starburst galaxies (α~ 1.2).

On global scales, the distribution of the X-ray emission looks remarkably similar to that seen in Hα (comparing azimuthal averages); locally, however, their distribution is clearly distinct in many cases, which can be explained by the different emission mechanisms (forward versus reverse shocks). Mass loading of order 1 to 5 is required to explain the differences between the amount of hot gas and the modelled mass loss from massive stars. The metallicity of the dwarf galaxies correlates with the diffuse X-ray luminosity and anticorrelates with the cooling time of the hot gas. The diffuse X-ray luminosity is also a function of the current star formation rate (SFR). The mechanical luminosities of the developing superwinds are energetic enough to overcome the gravitational potentials of their host galaxies. This scenario is supported by the overpressures of the hot gas compared with the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Extended HI envelopes such as tidal tails, however, may delay outflows on time-scales exceeding those of the cooling time of the hot gas.","keyword":["ISM: jets and outflows","galaxies: dwarf","intergalactic medium","galaxies: starburst","X-rays: galaxies","X-rays: ISM","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We find that, even in the relatively short GEMS observing period, the ACS PSF ellipticity varies at the level of a few per cent which we account for with a semi-time-dependent PSF model. Our correction for the temporal and spatial variability of the PSF is shown to be successful through a series of diagnostic tests.","keyword":["gravitational lensing","cosmology: observations","large-scale structure of Universe","Astrophysics"]}]}}

When allowance is made for incompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that predicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of sufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and homogeneity of the z 〉 0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is inferred for 75 per cent of our spectroscopic sample, a higher fraction than that seen in smaller, less complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria (e.g. R-K). However, only 28 per cent have spectra with no evidence of recent star formation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively evolving population. More than ~30 per cent of our absorption-line spectra are of the `E+A' type with prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of 5-15 per cent in the past gigayear. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier estimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand the significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to pinpoint a filamentary structure at z= 1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South. Overall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an established population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent activity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8 〈 z 〈 1.6.","keyword":["galaxies: distances and redshifts","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: stellar content","large-scale structure of Universe","Astrophysics"]}]}}

In principle, to explain this phenomenon, at least two different routes may be followed: either adjusting the energy content of the Universe—by introducing a negative-pressure dark energy—or modifying gravity at very large scales—by introducing new spatial dimensions, an idea also required by unification theories. In the cosmological context, the role of such extra dimensions as the source of the dark pressure responsible for the acceleration of our Universe is translated into the so-called brane world (BW) cosmologies. Here we study complementary constraints on a particular class of BW scenarios in which the modification of gravity arises due to a gravitational leakage into extra dimensions. To this end, we use the most recent Chandra measurements of the X-ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, the WMAP determinations of the baryon density parameter, measurements of the Hubble parameter from the HST, and the current supernova data. In agreement with other recent results, it is shown that these models provide a good description for these complementary data, although a closed scenario is always favored in the joint analysis. If we restrict our analysis to the flat case, in accordance with the latest CMB measurements, we found that the so-called “concordance model”, i.e., a flat ΛCDM universe, provides a slightly better fit to this particular combination of observational data than does a BW model.

Geminga is for the first time reliably detected in the I band with a magnitude of 25.^m10±0.14. The dereddened spectra of both pulsars are remarkably similar to each other and show significant flux increases towards the far-UV and near-IR, and a wide flux excess in V-I bands. This suggests a multicomponent structure of the optical emission. The nonthermal power law component of the pulsar magnetospheric origin dominates in the most part of the optical range. For PSR B0656+14 it is compatible with a low energy extension of the power law tail seen in hard X-rays. For Geminga the respective extension overshoots by a factor of 100 the nonthermal optical flux, which has a less steep spectral slope than in X-rays. This implies a spectral break at a photon energy ~1 keV. The flux increases towards the far-UV are compatible with contributions of the Rayleigh-Jeans parts of the blackbody components from whole surfaces of the neutron stars dominating in soft X-rays. The V-I excess, which is most significant for PSR B0656+14, suggests a third spectral component of still unidentified origin.

We investigate light curves as well as medium and high-resolution X-ray spectra to determine the plasma properties of the sample CTTS and to study the origin of their X-ray emission and its variability. The emission measure distributions and observed temperatures differ significantly and the targets are dominated either by plasma at high densities as produced by accretion shocks or by predominantly hotter plasma of coronal origin. Likewise the variability of the X-ray luminosity is found to be generated by both mechanisms. Cool plasma at high densities is found in all stars with detected O VII triplet emission, prevented only for SU Aur due to strong absorption. A general trend is present in the abundance pattern, with neon being at solar value or enhanced while oxygen, iron and most other metals are depleted, pointing to the presence of the inverse FIP effect in active coronae and possibly grain formation in evolved disks. We find that both accretion shocks and coronal activity contribute to the observed X-ray emission of the targets. While coronal activity is the dominant source of X-ray activity in the majority of the CTTS, the fraction for each process differs significantly between the individual objects.","keyword":["stars: activity","stars: coronae","stars: late-type","stars: pre-main sequence","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics"]}]}}

A similar trend, with a more modest decrease in the mass function, is also shared by spiral galaxies, while the irregulars/mergers show an increased incidence at higher z. Remarkably, this decrease in the comoving density with redshift of the total population appears to depend on galaxy mass, being stronger for moderate-mass galaxies, but almost absent until z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous evidence of a “downsizing” effect in galaxy formation.<BR />Conclusions.Our favoured interpretation of the evolutionary trends for the two galaxy categories is that of a progressive morphological transformation (due to gas exhaustion and, likely, merging) from the star-forming to the passively evolving phase, starting at z≥ 2 and holding on down to z̃ 0.7.

Heating of the gas to X-ray temperatures comes from the high velocity that it reaches (≈700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) as it falls to the bottom of the potential well. This would explain why the stellar metallicity in the bulge region is around solar while the hot gas metallicity is around 0.1 solar. We carried out an observational test to check this hypothesis by measuring the metallicity of HII regions in the outer ring to check whether they matched the hot gas metallicity. For this purpose we obtained medium resolution long slit spectroscopy with FORS1 on the ESO VLT at Paranal and obtained the metallicities using emission line ratio diagnostics. The obtained metallicities are compatible with the bulge stellar metallicities but very different from the hot-gas metallicity. However, when comparing the different time-scales, the gas in the ring had time enough to get enriched through stellar processes, therefore we cannot rule out the dynamical mechanism as the heating process of the gas. However, the blue colours of the outer ring and the dust structures in the bar region could suggest that the origin of the X-ray hot gas is due to the infall of material from further out.","keyword":["galaxies: ISM","galaxies: structure","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","Galaxy: abundances","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We detected 303 distinct X-ray sources by analysing six EPIC/pn observations; 194 of them are members of the cluster. Stars of all spectral types, from the early-types to the late-M dwarfs, were detected. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to the X-ray photon time series shows that, on short time scales, only a relatively small fraction (ranging from 6% to 31% for dG and dF, respectively) of the members of NGC 2516 are variable with a confidence level ≥99%; however, it is possible that the fraction is small only because of the poor statistics. The time X-ray amplitude distribution functions (XAD) of a set of dF7-dK2 stars, derived on short (hours) and medium (months) time scales, seem to suggest that medium-term variations, if present, have a much smaller amplitude than those on short time scales; a similar result is also obtained for dK3-dM stars.

The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a plume stretching toward the cluster center seen in soft X-rays by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in [O II] emission and near-UV continuum light. Hubble Space Telescope imaging shows a distorted disk with star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant spiral structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and ionized gas in this disk are kinematically decoupled, demonstrating that pressure stripping (possibly turbulent, as well as ram) must be important, and that tidal disruption is not the only mechanism at work. Comparison of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical data on the plume highlight significant and poorly known features of the history of stripped gas in the intracluster medium that could be clarified through further observations of this system. The nucleus of C153 also hosts an active galactic nucleus, shown by the weak and distorted extended radio emission and a radio-compact core. The unusual strength of the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related to the very high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the intracluster medium during a cluster-cluster merger and its passage very near the core of the cluster. An additional sign of recent dynamical events is the diffuse starlight asymmetrically placed about the central triple in a cD envelope.

In addition to the extensive [O III] filaments, we have detected four small complexes of filaments that show [S II] emission along with the oxygen lines. In a single long-slit spectrum we find variations of almost an order of magnitude in the relative strengths of oxygen and sulfur lines, which must result from abundance variations. None of the filaments, with or without [S II], shows any evidence for hydrogen, so all appear to be fragments of pure supernova ejecta. The [S II] filaments provide the first evidence for undiluted products of oxygen burning in the ejecta from the supernova that gave rise to G292.0+1.8. Some oxygen burning, either hydrostatic or explosive, must have occurred, but the paucity of [S II]-emitting filaments suggests that either the oxygen burning was not extensive or that most of its products have yet to be excited.

When the white dwarf atmosphere is observed, atmospheric models show promising preliminary results. In two objects, very anomalous abundances are found. One of them is a very bright classical nova, V4743 Sgr, observed 6-18 months after the outburst. The absorption lines appear to be blue-shifted, which may be attributed to a still expanding atmosphere. Carbon is strongly depleted with respect to the solar value, indicating CNO processed material, expected if the nova has not ejected all accreted material, and the white dwarf mass is growing during the secular evolution. In principle, such a nova may be a type Ia SN progenitor. X-ray grating observations can also be used for studying classical novae in quiescence, if they are sufficiently bright.

We find evidence for variability in three sources between this observation and a previous Chandra observation. Additionally, we detect five sources that were not detected with Chandra despite its better detection limit, suggesting that these sources have since brightened. The total X-ray spectrum of the resolved sources is well fit by a hard power law, while the diffuse spectrum requires a hard and a soft component, presumably due to the relatively soft diffuse gas and the harder unresolved sources. A deprojection of the diffuse emission revealed a radial temperature gradient that is hot in the center, drops to a minimum at about 20\"-50\" (1.6-4.1 kpc), and rises again in the outer regions. The diffuse emission appears to require a two-temperature model with heavy-element abundance ratios that differ from the solar values.

The fingers are morphologically similar to radial features seen in hydrodynamic simulations of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies, and although their other properties do not match the predictions of the particular simulations used, we conclude that the radial fingers might be due to convective motions of hot outflowing gas and cooler inflowing gas. We also find evidence for a longer, previously undetected filament that extends to the northeastern edge of NGC 4649. The diffuse gas in the region of the filament appears to have a lower temperature and may also have a higher abundance as compared to nearby regions.

Two years and an effective exposure of 4.7×10<SUP>6</SUP> s have allowed us to obtain more stringent positional constraints on this high-energy source and to construct its spectrum in the range 20-400 keV. Furthermore, by combining the ISGRI spectrum with the total X-ray spectrum corresponding to the same physical region around Sgr A* from XMM-Newton data collected during part of the γ-ray observations, we constructed and present the first accurate wideband high-energy spectrum for the central arcminutes of the Galaxy. Our complete and updated analysis of the emission properties of the INTEGRAL source shows that it is faint but persistent with no variability above 3 σ, contrary to what was alluded to in our first paper. This result, in conjunction with the spectral characteristics of the soft and hard X-ray emission from this region, suggests that the source is most likely not pointlike but rather that it is a compact yet diffuse nonthermal emission region.

Including low-frequency data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey allows us to develop a complete picture of the PWN and its evolution in a very complex environment. The radio continuum spectrum reveals a break between 4 and 5 GHz that is the result of synchrotron cooling. We find evidence that the reverse shock of the initial supernova shock wave has driven away the original PWN, which explains why the current nebula around the pulsar has such a low radio luminosity. An analysis of the energy budget of the pulsar, the magnetic field in the nebula, and the lifetime of relativistic electrons gives a magnetic field of 2.6 mG in the PWN with an age of 3900 yr. This is not the age of the SNR but the time that has passed since the reverse shock crushed the original PWN. A comparison of our polarization measurements with those of other PWNe leads to a simple model of the magnetic field structure within such an object. Using this model, we derive an angle of about 30° between the Galactic north and the spin axis of the pulsar, projected onto the plane of the sky. The spin axis is pointing away from us, toward the northwest. This agrees nicely with the results of Ng and Romani, who in a 2004 paper calculated an angle of 20° from their fits of a model torus to a Chandra measurement of the Boomerang.

Since this redshift is similar to the peak in the cosmic star formation rate, this paper proposes that the obscuring material required for AGN unification is regulated by star formation within the host galaxy.

The evolutionary models are constrained by parameterizing the observed type 1 AGN fractions from the recent work by Barger et al.

This is likely to be a lower limit given that the most obscured AGNs are missed in X-rays.

For other MSPs in the Galactic field for which the spectral index of the nonpulsed component has been measured (i.e., PSR B1937+21, PSR J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the nonpulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated.

The [O III] emission is more extended than other tracers, forming a faint ``skin'' around the denser filaments and synchrotron nebula, as also observed in the Crab.

We report the detection of several new near-IR flares during the campaign based on HST observations. The level of near-IR flare activity can be as low as ~0.15 mJy at 1.6 μm and continuous up to ~40% of the total observing time, thus placing better limits than ground-based near-IR observations. Using HST NICMOS, XMM-Newton, and CSO, we also detect simultaneous bright X-ray and near-IR flare in which we observe for the first time correlated substructures as well as simultaneous submillimeter and near-IR flaring. X-ray emission is arising from the population of near-IR-synchrotron-emitting particles, which scatter submillimeter seed photons within the inner 10 Schwarzschild radii of Sgr A* up to X-ray energies. In addition, using the inverse Compton scattering picture, we explain the high-energy 20-120 keV emission from the direction toward Sgr A*, and the lack of one-to-one X-ray counterparts to near-IR flares, by the variation of the magnetic field and the spectral index distributions. In this picture, the evidence for the variability of submillimeter emission during a near-IR flare is produced by the low-energy component of the population of particles emitting synchrotron near-IR emission.

We are able to explain the current observed diffuse gamma rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary positrons by p-p collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times and energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient material if the black hole captured a 50 M<SUB>solar</SUB> star at several tens times 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr ago.

There is a prominent redward asymmetry in the 6.4 keV line, which could indicate emission from a Compton shoulder. Alternatively, models using dual relativistic disk lines are found to describe the emission profile well. A low-inclination, moderately relativistic dual disk-line model is possible if the contribution from narrow components, due to distant material, is small or absent.

The longer wavelength radiation is produced at larger radii by electrons either diffusing from smaller scales or accelerated in situ. An important prediction of this model is the ejection of a significant flux of relativistic protons from a magnetic-field-dominated acceleration site into the wind-shocked medium surrounding the black hole. Recently, several air Cerenkov telescopes, notably HESS, have detected TeV emission from the Galactic center, with characteristics hinting at a p-p-induced pion decay process for the γ-ray emission. Given (1) the size of this acceleration region measured in the radio band and (2) the wind-injected ISM mapped with Chandra using the diffuse X-rays, it is feasible to test the idea that protons accelerated within ~20 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole produce the TeV emission farther out. We show a fraction of TeV protons scattering about once within ~3 pc of Sagittarius A* and the proton power (~10<SUP>37</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>) produced in concert with the 7 mm radio emission matches the TeV luminosity well. This model explains why the TeV source does not vary on a timescale of a year or less. The particle cascade generated by the p-p scatterings also produces bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, and synchrotron emission at longer wavelengths from secondary particles. We compare these with current measurements and demonstrate that GLAST will detect this source during its one-year all-sky survey.","keyword":["Acceleration of Particles","Black Hole Physics","Galaxy: Center","Gamma Rays: Theory","Plasmas","Turbulence","Astrophysics"]}]}}

Assuming that low-state objects accrete at approximately 10% of the Eddington luminosity (as found by Done & Gierlinski) and that high-state objects accrete near the Eddington luminosity, we further divided our sample of sources into low- and high-state ULX sources. We classify 16 sources as low-state ULXs and 26 objects as high-state ULXs. As in Galactic BH systems, the spectral indices, Γ, of the low-state objects, as well as the luminosities, tend to be lower than those of the high-state objects. The observed range of blackbody temperatures for the high state is 0.1-1 keV, with the most luminous systems tending toward the lowest temperatures. We therefore divide our high-state ULXs into candidate IMBHs (with blackbody temperatures of approximately 0.1 keV) and candidate stellar mass BHs (with blackbody temperatures of approximately 1.0 keV).

We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show that they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational potential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for gigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed in cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during core passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and dark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change in the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the cool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero impact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a characteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible disturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains its gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more easily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and often the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts sloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in X-rays for a long time.

The simulations of 11 individual clusters spanning a decade in mass are performed with the shock-capturing Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement N-body+gasdynamics ART code. To assess the impact of galaxy formation, we compare two sets of simulations performed in an adiabatic regime (without galaxy formation) with those with several physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation: radiative cooling, star formation, stellar feedback, and metal enrichment. We show that a SZE signal integrated to a sufficiently large fraction of cluster volume correlates strongly with its enclosed mass, independent of details of gas physics and the dynamical state of the cluster. The slope and redshift evolution of the SZE flux-mass relation are also insensitive to processes of galaxy formation and are well characterized by a simple self-similar cluster model. Its normalization, on the other hand, is significantly affected by gas cooling and associated star formation. Our simulations show that inclusion of these processes suppresses the normalization by ~30%-40%. The effect is due to a decrease in gas mass fraction, which is offset slightly by an increase in gas-mass-weighted temperature. Gas cooling and star formation also cause an increase in total mass and modify the normalization by a few percent. Finally, we compare the results of our simulations to recent observations of the SZE scaling relations obtained using 36 OVRO/BIMA SZE + Chandra X-ray observations. The comparison highlights the importance of galaxy formation in theoretical modeling of clusters and shows that the current generation of simulations produces clusters with gross properties quite similar to their observed counterparts.","keyword":["Cosmology: Theory","Galaxies: Clusters: General","Methods: Numerical","Astrophysics"]}]}}

Where channel 1 is strong with respect to the other IRAC channels, the longer wavelength spectra show a broad continuum gently peaking around 26 μm, with weak or no lines. We suggest that this is due to unenriched progenitor circumstellar dust behind the outer shock.

This survey is obtaining spectra of a random large sample of Magellanic Cloud supernova remnants with a broad range of radio, optical, and X-ray properties. We proposed 39 objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 11 objects from the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a standard request of 10 ks per object using the FUSE 30\" square aperture. To date, 39 objects have been observed in the survey (38 in the LMC and 1 in the SMC) and 15 have been detected, a detection rate of nearly 40%. Our survey has nearly tripled the number of UV-detected SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds (from 8 to 22). Because of the diffuse source sensitivity of FUSE, upper limits on nondetected objects are quite sensitive in many cases, dependent on night observing fraction and whether stellar light contamination plays a role for a given object. Estimated total luminosities in O VI, based simply on scaling the flux at the observed positions to an entire object, span a broad range from considerably brighter to many times fainter than the inferred soft X-ray luminosities, indicating that O VI can be an important and largely unrecognized coolant in certain objects. We compare the optical and X-ray properties of the detected and nondetected objects but do not find a simple indicator for ultraviolet detectability. Nondetections may be due to clumpiness of the emission, high foreground extinction, slow shocks whose emission gets attenuated by the Magellanic interstellar medium, or a combination of these effects.

The main motivation is to address the nature of ULXs by searching for optical counterparts. Sixteen of the ULXs are found in early-type galaxies (RC3 Hubble type 〈3). We have improved the Chandra/HST relative astrometry whenever possible, resulting in errors circles of 0.3\"-1.7\" in size. Disparate numbers of potential ULX counterparts are found, and in some cases none are found. The lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be due to insufficient depth in the WFPC2 images. Particularly in late-type galaxies, the HST image in the ULX region was often complex or crowded, requiring source detection to be performed manually. We therefore address various scenarios for the nature of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of the sources found are true counterparts. The optical luminosities of the sources are typically in the range 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>, with (effective) V magnitudes typically in the range 22-24. In several cases color information is available, with the colors roughly tending to be more red in early-type galaxies. This suggests that, in general, the (potential) counterparts found in early-type galaxies are likely to be older stellar populations and are probably globular clusters. Several early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies, however, these could also be background sources. In spiral galaxies the sources may also be due to localized structure in the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively, some of the counterparts in late-type galaxies may be isolated supergiant stars. The observed X-ray/optical flux ratio is diluted by the optical emission of the cluster in cases where the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly in the case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in an old cluster. If any of the counterparts are bound systems with ~10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> stars and are the true counterparts to the ULX sources, then the X-ray luminosities of the ULX are generally well below the Eddington limit for a black hole with mass ~0.1% of the cluster mass. Finally, we find that the optical flux of the counterparts is consistent with being dominated by emission from an accretion disk around an intermediate-mass black hole if the black hole happens to have a mass 〉~10<SUP>2</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and is accreting at close to the Eddington rate, unless the accretion disk is irradiated (which would result in high optical disk luminosities at lower black hole masses).Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA  Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

In our analysis of the Chandra spectra, we determined that the X-ray absorption was dominated by two components: a high-ionization absorber, revealed by the presence of H-like and He-like lines of Mg, Si, and S, and a lower ionization absorber, in which inner shell absorption lines from lower ionization species of these elements formed. We identified the latter as the source of the saturated UV lines of O VI, C IV, and N V associated with the absorption feature at a radial velocity of ~-500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which we referred to as component D+E. In the present work, we have derived tighter constrains on the line-of-sight covering factors, densities, and radial distances of the absorbers. We confirm the presence of the three subcomponents of D+E described in our previous paper, with line-of-sight covering factors (C<SUB>los</SUB>) ranging from ~0.5 to 0.9, and find evidence for a fourth component, D+Ed, characterized by low ionization and a C<SUB>los</SUB>~0.2. The complexity of the UV absorption in NGC 4151 may be a consequence of the fact that we are viewing the black hole/accretion disk system at a relatively high inclination and, therefore, may be detecting the densest part of the flow. Our deconvolution of the underlying C IV emission indicates that D+E must lie outside the intermediate line region (ILR), hence at a radial distance of ~0.1 pc. We find that the equivalent widths (EWs) of the low-ionization lines associated with D+E varied over the period from 1999 July to 2002 May. Although over part of this time, the variations were correlated with changes in the UV continuum, the drop in the EWs of these lines between 2001 April and 2002 May are suggestive of bulk motion of gas out of our line of sight. Over this period, C<SUB>los</SUB> for the low-ionization absorption lines dropped from ~0.7 to ~0.2. If these lines from these two epochs arose in the same subcomponent, the transverse velocity of the gas is ~2100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is similar to the constraint on transverse velocity derived from the drop in the X-ray absorbing column between 2000 March and 2002 May. Transverse velocities of this order are consistent with an origin in a rotating disk, at the roughly radial distance we derived for D+E. As we suggested in our previous study, it is likely that the absorption arises in a disk-driven wind.Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555 these observations are associated with proposal GO-9272.

These coronae extend outwards until either the pressure of the hot coronal gas overcomes the magnetic field, or, if the corona interacts with a disc before this happens, by the action of the disc itself. This work is motivated by the results of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project that show an increase in the X-ray emission measure (EM) with increasing stellar mass. We find that this variation (and its large scatter) results naturally from the variation in the sizes of the stellar coronae. The reduction in the magnitude of the X-ray emission due to the presence of a disc stripping the outer parts of the stellar corona is most pronounced for the lower mass stars. The higher mass stars with their greater surface gravities have coronae that typically do not extend out as far as the inner edge of the disc and so are less affected by it. For these stars, accretion takes place along open field lines that connect to the disc. By extrapolating surface magnetograms of young main-sequence stars, we have examined the effect on the X-ray emission of a realistic degree of field complexity.

Starting from the hydrodynamic simulations of Reynolds, Heinz & Begelman, we calculate the properties of the highly ionized iron and oxygen lines (seen in absorption against the central AGN), predicting line shapes, equivalent widths, column densities and velocity shifts. The main effect of the jet on the absorption lines is a reduction of the line strength from that of the quiescent ICM and the introduction of some velocity structure in the line profile. We investigate whether these features are detectable with current as well as future high-resolution X-ray spectrometers. We conclude that the Chandra transmission gratings have insufficient sensitivity to detect these features with high significance, and certainly would not allow a study of the dynamics of the interaction via absorption signatures. Constellation-X, on the other hand, will allow superb constraints to be derived. We can also use this analysis to assess the idea that radio galaxy induced ICM outflows give rise to the resonant oxygen X-ray absorption lines that have been claimed as evidence for the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).

Using data from the literature it is shown that no correlation exists between the Fe Kα core width and the BLR (specifically Hβ) line width. This shows that in general the iron Kα core emission does not arise from the BLR. There is a similar lack of correlation between the width of the Fe Kα core and black hole mass.

A promising possibility to explain these sources is given by in situ stochastic reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster volume during merger events. Cassano and Brunetti have recently shown that the expected fraction of clusters with radio haloes and the increase of such a fraction with cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a fraction of 20-30 per cent of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of compressible modes.In this work, we extend the above-mentioned analysis by including a scaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that, in the framework of the reacceleration model, the observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17 GRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the form B ~ M<SUP>b</SUP><SUB>v</SUB>, with b 〉~ 0.5 and typical μG strengths of the average B intensity.

Extending the source counts beyond z = 0.2, we estimate that the total number of GRHs to be discovered at ~ mJy radio fluxes could be ~100 at 1.4 GHz.

In this paper, we present the results of a time-series analysis performed on the X-ray light curve (LC) obtained in this observation, and in a previous shorter observation done with Chandra 16d earlier. Intense variability, with amplitude as large as 40 per cent of the total flux, was observed both times. Similarities can be found between the two observations in the structure of the variations. Most of the variability is well represented as a combination of oscillations at a set of discrete frequencies lower than 1.7mHz. At least five frequencies are constant over the 16d time interval between the two observations. We suggest that a period in the power spectrum of both LCs at the frequency of 0.75mHz and its first harmonic are related to the spin period of the white dwarf (WD) in the system, and that other observed frequencies are signatures of non-radial WD pulsations. A possible signal with a 24000s period is also found in the XMM-Newton LC: a cycle and a half are clearly identified. This period is consistent with the 24278s periodicity discovered in the optical LC of the source and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary stellar system.","keyword":["novae","cataclysmic variables","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics"]}]}}

It can be easily anticipated that after the above-mentioned discovery other neutron stars characterized by enormous magnetic fields will also become the objects for astronomical observations and studies. In the review a detailed qualitative and quantitative consideration of the one-electron molecular systems H2+(ppe),H3++(pppe),H43+(ppppe) and (HeH)<SUP>++</SUP>(αpe),He23+(ααe) in a magnetic field ranging from 10<SUP>9</SUP> to 4.414×10<SUP>13</SUP> G (the Schwinger limit) is presented. The main emphasis is made on the question of the existence of the corresponding molecular ions in a magnetic field. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation of zero order (infinitely heavy protons and/or α-particles) is used throughout. It is shown that for a magnetic field B≲10<SUP>11</SUP> G the H2+-ion always exists for any inclination of the molecular axis with respect to the magnetic line. For B≳10<SUP>11</SUP> G and large inclinations the minimum in the total energy curve disappears and the molecular ion H2+ ceases to exist. The domain of inclinations where the H2+-ion exists, reduces as the magnetic field increases and finally becomes 0- 25<SUP>∘</SUP> at B=4.414×10<SUP>13</SUP> G. The optimal configuration of H2+ always corresponds to protons situated along the magnetic line (the parallel configuration). With magnetic field growth the ion H2+ becomes more and more tightly bound and compact, and the electronic distribution evolves from a two-peak to a one-peak pattern. It is always stable. Several low-lying excited states are studied. The fact that the system (pppe) can be bound in a strong magnetic field to form the H3++-ion was mentioned for the first time at 1999. In the range of magnetic fields 10<SUP>8</SUP>〈B〈10<SUP>11</SUP> G the H3++-ion with the protons forming an equilateral triangle perpendicular to the magnetic line exists. This configuration is unstable under decays to H-atom+p+p and H2++p. The triangular configuration of H3++ complements the H3++-ion in the linear, parallel configuration which exists for B≳10<SUP>10</SUP> G. A study of several low-lying excited states for H3++ in the parallel configuration is presented. For B≳3×10<SUP>13</SUP> G another molecular ion H43+ can exist in parallel configuration. In general, the neutral system-the hydrogen atom-has the highest total energy among the one-electron linear systems in the parallel configuration, so is the least bound but stable one-electron system for the whole region of magnetic fields studied, 0〈B≲4.414×10<SUP>13</SUP> G. Among one-electron systems containing protons, H2+ has the lowest total energy for 0〈B≲10<SUP>13</SUP> G. However, for B≳10<SUP>13</SUP> G the exotic system H3++ has the lowest total energy and is stable. The exotic systems containing α-particles, (HeH)<SUP>++</SUP>(αpe) and He23+(ααe) can exist in a magnetic field B≳10<SUP>12</SUP> G and B≳2.35×10<SUP>11</SUP> G, respectively. In general, the ion He23+ is characterized by the highest binding energy among known one-electron systems made from protons and/or α-particles. A variational method with an optimization of the form of the vector potential (optimal gauge fixing) is used as a main tool. Phase transition type behavior of variational parameters which appears for some interproton distances and which is related to the beginning of the chemical reaction, for example, H2+↔H+p is investigated."}]}}

The large body of observational results collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are used to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and its contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately obscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison between the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low luminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no clear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The distribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by matching the soft and hard source counts. A distribution rising towards larger column densities is able to reproduce the soft and hard AGN counts over about 6 dex in flux. The model also reproduces with excellent accuracy the fraction of obscured objects in AGN samples selected at different X-ray fluxes. The integrated emission of the Compton-thin AGN population is found to underestimate the XRB flux at about 30 keV, calling for an additional population of extremely obscured (Compton-thick) AGN. Since the number of Compton-thick sources required to fit the 30 keV XRB emission strongly depends on the spectral templates assumed for unobscured and moderately obscured AGN, we explored the effects of varying the spectral templates. In particular, in addition to the column density distribution, we also considered a distribution in the intrinsic powerlaw spectral indices of variable width. In our baseline model a Gaussian distribution of photon indices with mean 〈 Γ 〉=1.9 and dispersion σ<SUB>Γ</SUB>=0.2 is assumed. This increases the contribution of the Compton-thin AGN population to the 30 keV XRB intensity by ~30% with respect to the case of null dispersion (i.e. a single primary AGN powerlaw with Γ=1.9) but is not sufficient to match the 30 keV XRB emission. Therefore a population of heavily obscured -Compton-thick- AGN, as large as that of moderately obscured AGN, is required to fit the residual background emission. Remarkably, the fractions of Compton-thick AGN observed in the Chandra Deep Field South and in the first INTEGRAL and Swift catalogs of AGN selected above 10 keV are in excellent agreement with the model predictions.","keyword":["X-rays: galaxies","galaxies: active","X-rays: general","cosmology: diffuse radiation","X-rays: diffuse background","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We find that, for a sample of local star-forming galaxies (i.e., normal spirals and mild starbursts), L_x^yXP correlates linearly with the SFR over three decades in luminosity. A separate, high-SFR sample of starburst ULIRGs can be used to check the calibration of the relation. Using their (presumably SF-related) total 2-10 keV luminosities we find that these sources satisfy the SFR-L_x^yXP relation, as defined by the weaker sample, and extend it to span ̃5 decades in luminosity. The SFR-L_x^yXP relation is also likely to hold for distant (z ̃ 1) Hubble Deep Field North galaxies, especially so if these high-SFR objects are similar to the (more nearby) ULIRGs. It is argued that the SFR-L_x^yXP relation provides the most adequate X-ray estimator of instantaneous SFR by the phenomena characterizing massive stars from their birth (FIR emission from placental dust clouds) through their death as compact remnants (emitting X-rays by accreting from a close donor). For local, low/intermediate-SFR galaxies, the simultaneous existence of a correlation of the instantaneous SFR with the total 2-10 keV luminosity, L_x, which traces the SFR integrated over the last ̃10<SUP>9</SUP> yr, suggests that during such epoch the SF in these galaxies has been proceeding at a relatively constant rate.","keyword":["galaxies: starburst","infrared: galaxies","radio continuum: galaxies","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We discover the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung component in the aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux above 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected for lack of sensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This bremsstrahlung component varied significantly in strength and spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the Nov. 2003 observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum with increasing flux. This variability may be linked to the strong solar activity taking place at the time, and may be induced by changes in the acceleration mechanisms inside Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra below 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission most likely originating from ion charge exchange, with OVII playing the dominant role. We still cannot resolve conclusively the ion species responsible for the lowest energy lines (around 0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions (magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open. It is conceivable that both scenarios play a role in what is certainly a very complex planetary structure. High resolution spectra of the whole planet obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer in the range 0.5-1 keV clearly separate emission lines (mostly of iron) originating at low latitudes on Jupiter from the auroral lines due to oxygen. These are shown to possess very broad wings which imply velocities of ~5000 km s^-1. Such speeds are consistent with the energies at which precipitating and charge exchanging oxygen ions are expected to be accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Overall we find good agreement between our measurements and the predictions of recently developed models of Jupiter's auroral processes.","keyword":["planets and satellites: general","planets and satellites:","individual: Jupiter","X-rays: general","Astrophysics"]}]}}

This source was observed 5 times from 1996 to 2001 with durations ranging from a day to four days. The intrinsic continuum (described as a cut-off power law) is absorbed at low energies by a complex system: a cold patchy absorber plus a warm uniform screen photoionised by the central continuum. We find that this \"dual absorber\" is the main driver of the observed variability, up to a factor of eight, at 3 keV. In particular the covering fraction of the cold absorber changes on time scales of the order of a day, supporting its association with the broad-line region. The column density of the warm gas varies on a longer time scale (months to year). Some of the small amplitude spectral variability above 10 keV can be explained with an intrinsic variation (with variation of the photon index ΔΓ ̃ 0.2). The flux below 1 keV remains constant confirming an extended origin. Its spectrum is reproduced by a combination of a thermal component (with temperature kT=0.15 keV) and a power law with the same slope as the intrinsic continuum, but with an intensity of a few percent. A Compton reflection component is significantly detected in 1996 (averaged value of Ω/2π ̃0.4, with the solid angle Ω covered by the reflecting medium), with intensity decreasing on a time scale of a year, and it desappears in 2000 and 2001. The long time scale of variations argues for an association with an optically thick torus at a distance of a few light years. An iron line was detected in all spectra. Its energy is consistent with fluorescence by cold iron. We find that the line is variable. Its behaviour is reproduced by a variable component proportional to the level of the reflection flux plus a constant component. The flux of the latter is consistent with the extended line emission observed by Chandra.

X-rays probably originate in the wind's terminal velocity regime in collisionless shocks controlled by magnetic fields rather than in cooling shocks in the acceleration zone. During post-shock relaxation, exchange of energy between ions and electrons is so slow that electron heating does not take place before hot gas is quenched by the majority cool gas. The observed plasma is not in equilibrium and the electron bremsstrahlung continuum is weak. Charge exchange, ionization and excitation are likely to be produced by protons. Fully thermalized post-shock velocities ensure high cross-sections and account for the observed line widths, with some allowance probably necessary for non-thermal particle acceleration. In general, the form of X-ray spectra in both single and binary stars is likely to be determined principally by the amount of post-shock electron heating: magnetically confined X-ray plasma in binary systems can evolve further towards the higher electron temperatures of equilibrium while in single stars this does not take place.

The 0.2-150 keV spectrum, obtained with BeppoSAX, is the widest for this source available to date in terms of spectral coverage and is well described by a model consisting of a lower-energy thermal component (hot diffuse gas) plus a higher-energy (Comptonization) emission, with the latter modified by a partially-covering cold absorber plus a warm (ionized) absorber. A blackbody modelization of our BeppoSAX low-energy data is ruled out. The presence of a complex absorber local to the source is also supported by the 0.1-2 keV ROSAT spectrum. RXTE, EXOSAT and Swift X-ray spectroscopy is consistent with the above results, but indicates variations in the density and the ionization of the local absorber. A 6.5 keV iron emission line is possibly detected in the BeppoSAX and RXTE spectra.

The fractions of the XRB resolved in the surveys used in this work are 87%, 85%, 60% and 25% in the soft, hard, XID and ultra-hard bands, respectively. Extrapolation of our source counts to zero flux is not sufficient to saturate the XRB intensity. Only galaxies and/or absorbed AGN could contribute the remaining unresolved XRB intensity. Our results are compatible, within the errors, with recent revisions of the XRB intensity in the soft and hard bands. The maximum fractional contribution to the XRB comes from fluxes within about a decade of the break in the source counts (~10<SUP>-14</SUP> cgs), reaching ~50% of the total in the soft and hard bands. Angular clustering (widely distributed over the sky and not confined to a few deep fields) is detected at 99-99.9% significance in the soft and XID bands, with no detection in the hard and ultra-hard band (probably due to the smaller number of sources). We cannot confirm the detection of significantly stronger clustering in the hard-spectrum hard sources.  <BR />Conclusions: Medium depth surveys such as AXIS are essential to determine the evolution of the X-ray emission in the Universe below 10 keV.Table 1 and Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org Based on observations obtained with XMM-newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).

The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by “core” galaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in “power-law” galaxies. We extend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V_rec 〈 7000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) Seyfert galaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. From the nuclear point of view, they show a large deficit of radio emission (at a given X-ray or narrow line luminosity) with respect to radio-loud AGN, conforming with their identification as radio-quiet AGN. We used the available HST images to study their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated galaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be successfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic of “power-law” galaxies (with logarithmic slope γ = 0.51-1.07). This result is what is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thus extending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radio loudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of this result against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightness profiles, using a Sérsic law. In no object could we find evidence of a central light deficit with respect to a pure Sérsic model, the defining feature of “core” galaxies in this modeling framework. We conclude that, regardless of the modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocally related to the host's brightness profile. Our general results can be re-phrased as “radio-loud nuclei are hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN are found in non-core galaxies”.Based on observations obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated, under NASA contract BAS 5-26555.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: Seyfert","galaxies: bulges","galaxies:","nuclei","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular","cD","Astrophysics"]}]}}

In order to identify the most extreme objects and to complement previously published selections in this field, we confined our study to the galaxies undetected by the optical HST+ACS imaging and close to the detection limit of the K-band image (K〉23.5 AB). Our selection unveiled 20 galaxies on which we performed a detailed analysis. For each galaxy, we built a spectral energy distribution (SED) based on optical-to-8μm photometry. The SEDs were then used to estimate the photometric redshifts and to derive the main galaxies' physical properties. Further constraints were also obtained from the available X-ray and 24 μm data.   <BR />Results: The majority of the sample (14 out of 20) sources show degenerate/bimodal solutions for the photometric redshifts.

One galaxy, ID-6, the only source in our sample with both an X-ray and a 24 μm detection, might be an extremely massive object at z̃ 8 detected during a post-starburst phase with concomitant QSO activity responsible for the 24 μm and X-ray emissions (although a lower-z solution is not excluded).   <BR />Conclusions: Our investigation of Spitzer-selected galaxies that have very red SEDs and completely undetected in the optical reveals a potential population of massive galaxies at z≥4, which appear to include significant AGN emissions.

The interferometric measurements are spectrally resolved with λ/Δ λ = 30 in the wavelength range 8 to 13 μm. Their resolution reaches 15 mas at the shortest wavelengths. Supplementary observations were obtained in the near-infrared with the adaptive optics instrument NACO, and at mm wavelengths with SEST and JCMT.  <BR />Methods: The mid-infrared emission from the core of Centaurus A is dominated by an unresolved point source (〈10 mas).

We conclude that at the shell and along the internal filaments, the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission were accelerated at the shock according to a simple diffusive shock model. The positive spectrum corresponds to a location where the SN shock is running into a molecular cloud and the line of sight intersects the photo dissociation region of an HII region and a young stellar object is present. Such spectral inversion is a classic signature of thermal absorption, either from ionized gas in the postshock region, from the HII region itself, or both.

Their nature is still unclear.  <BR />Aims: We report the discovery of a 4 h modulation for an ultraluminous SSS in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4631, observed with XMM-Newton in 2002 June. Temporal and spectral analysis of the source is performed.  <BR />Methods: We use a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis for the period search and evaluate the confidence level using Monte-Carlo simulations. We measure the source temperature, flux and luminosity through spectral fitting. <BR />Results: A modulation of 4.2±0.4 h (3σ error) was found for the SSS with a confidence level 〉99%. Besides dips observed in the light curve, the flux decreased by a factor of 3 within ~10 h. The spectrum can be described with an absorbed blackbody model with kT̃67 eV. The absorbed luminosity in the 0.2-2 keV energy band was 2.7×10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> while the bolometric luminosity was a hundred time higher (3.2×10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), making the source one of the most luminous of its class, assuming the best fit model is correct. <BR />Conclusions: This source is another very luminous SSS for which the standard white dwarf interpretation cannot be applied, unless a strong beaming factor is considered. A stellar-mass black hole accreting at a super Eddington rate is a more likely interpretation, where the excess of accreted matter is ejected through a strong optically-thick outflow. The 4 h modulation could either be an eclipse from the companion star or the consequence of a warped accretion disk.","keyword":["galaxies: individual: NGC 4631","X-rays: galaxies","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We also conducted near infrared observations with the 3.5 m telescope and the OMEGA2000 camera at the Centro Astronómico Hispano Alemán (CAHA) in Almería (Spain).  <BR />Results: We present deep radio maps centered on the TeV J2032+4130 position at different wavelengths. In particular, our 49 and 20 cm maps cover a field of view larger than half a degree that fully includes the Whipple position and the peak of MILAGRO emission. Our most important result here is a catalogue of 153 radio sources detected at 49 cm within the GMRT antennae primary beam with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 43 arc-minute. Among them, peculiar sources inside the Whipple error ellipse are discussed in detail, including a likely double-double radio galaxy and a one-sided jet source of possible blazar nature. This last object adds another alternative counterpart possibility to be considered for both the HEGRA, Whipple and MILAGRO emission. Moreover, our multi-configuration VLA images reveal the non-thermal extended emission previously reported by us with improved angular resolution. Its non-thermal spectral index is also confirmed thanks to matching beam observations at the 20 and 6 cm wavelengths.Table 3 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org","keyword":["radio continuum: stars","X-rays: binaries","galaxies: active","gamma rays: observations","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We compare our results with models, complementing them with available measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy.  <BR />Results: The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation, consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure.  <BR />Conclusions: GRB 050724 provides the most compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old stellar population.

XMM-Newton observations on July 2-3 and December 18-19, 2006 added information on the X-ray and UV states of the source.  <BR />Results: The source was in a faint state. The radio flux at the higher frequencies showed a fast decreasing trend, which represents the tail of the big radio outburst. It was followed by a quiescent state, common at all radio frequencies. In contrast, moderate activity characterized the near-IR and optical light curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude with increasing wavelength. We ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to the presence of a “little blue bump” due to line emission from the broad line region, which is clearly visible in the source spectral energy distribution (SED) during faint states. Moreover, the data from the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor reveal a rise of the SED in the ultraviolet, suggesting the existence of a “big blue bump” due to thermal emission from the accretion disc. The X-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model with photoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the Galactic one. However, the comparison with previous X-ray observations would imply that the amount of absorbing matter is variable. Alternatively, the intrinsic X-ray spectrum presents a curvature, which may depend on the X-ray brightness. In this case, two scenarios are possible. i) There is no extra absorption, and the X-ray spectrum hardens at low energies, the hardening being more evident in bright states; ii) there is a constant amount of extra absorption, likely in the quasar environment, and the X-ray spectrum softens at low energies, at least in faint X-ray states. This softening might be the result of a flux contribution by the high-frequency tail of the big blue bump.The radio-to-optical datapresented in this paper are stored in the WEBT archive; for questions regarding their availability,please   contact the WEBT President Massimo Villata","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: quasars: general","galaxies: quasars: individual: <ASTROBJ>3C 454.3</ASTROBJ>","Astrophysics"]}]}}

This X-ray event, observed close to the center of the optical eclipse, is interpreted as an X-ray flare.  <BR />Conclusions: We explain the variable column density with the low-density accretion funnel flows blanketing the magnetosphere. The lack of X-ray eclipses indicates that X-ray emitting regions are located at high latitudes. Furthermore, the occurrence of a strong X-ray flare near the center of the optical eclipse suggests that the magnetically active areas are closely associated with the base of the high-density accretion funnel flow. We speculate that the impact of this free-falling accretion flow onto the strong magnetic field of the stellar corona may boost the X-ray emission.","keyword":["stars: individual: <ASTROBJ>AA Tauri</ASTROBJ>","stars: pre-main sequence","X-rays: stars","accretion","accretion disks","Astrophysics"]}]}}

The X-ray data are merged with extant optical and near-infrared photometry, spectral classifications, Hα emission strengths, and rotation periods to examine the interrelationships between coronal and chromospheric activity, rotation, stellar mass, and internal structure for a statistically significant sample of pre-main-sequence stars. A total of 300 distinct X-ray sources can be identified with optical or near-infrared counterparts. The sources are concentrated within three regions of the cluster: in the vicinity of S Mon, within the large emission/reflection nebulosity southwest of S Mon, and along the broad ridge of molecular gas that extends from the Cone Nebula to the NGC 2264 IRS 2 field. From the extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram of the cluster, ages and masses for the optically identified X-ray sources are derived. A median age of ~2.5 Myr and an apparent age dispersion of ~5 Myr are suggested by pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. The X-ray luminosity of the detected sources appears well correlated with bolometric luminosity, although there is considerable scatter in the relationship. Stellar mass contributes significantly to this dispersion, while isochronal age and rotation do not. X-ray luminosity and mass are well correlated such that L<SUB>X</SUB> ~ (M/M<SUB>odot</SUB>)<SUP>1.5</SUP>, similar to the relationship found within the younger Orion Nebula Cluster. No strong evidence is found for a correlation between E<SUB>H-K</SUB>, the near-infrared color excess, and the fractional X-ray luminosity, which suggests that optically thick dust disks have little direct influence on the observed X-ray activity levels. Among the X-ray-detected weak-line T Tauri stars, the fractional X-ray luminosity, L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>, is moderately well correlated with the fractional Hα luminosity, L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>, but only at the 2 σ level of significance. The cumulative distribution functions for the X-ray luminosities of the X-ray-detected classical and weak-line T Tauri stars within the cluster are comparable, assuming the demarcation between the two classes is at an Hα equivalent width of 10 Å. However, if the nondetections in X-rays for the entire sample of Hα emitters known within the cluster are taken into account, then the cumulative distribution functions of these two groups are clearly different, such that classical T Tauri stars are underdetected by at least a factor of 2 relative to the weak-line T Tauri stars. Examining a small subsample of X-ray-detected stars that are probable accretors based on the presence of strong Hα emission and near-infrared excess, we conclude that definitive nonaccretors are ~1.6 times more X-ray luminous than their accreting counterparts. In agreement with earlier published findings for the Orion Nebula Cluster, we find a slight positive correlation (valid at the 2 σ confidence level) between L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> and rotation period in NGC 2264. The lack of a strong anticorrelation between X-ray activity and rotation period in the stellar population of NGC 2264 suggests that either the deeply convective T Tauri stars are rotationally saturated or the physical mechanism responsible for generating magnetic fields in pre-main-sequence stars is distinct from the one that operates in evolved main-sequence stars.","keyword":["open clusters and associations: individual: NGC 2264","stars: chromospheres","stars: coronae","stars: pre-main sequence","stars: rotation","X-rays: stars"]}]}}

We find that the sharp X-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around ~75% of the periphery of the radio lobe and detect significant temperature jumps in the brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. This demonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock that is the result of an overpressure that has built up in the entire lobe over time. In addition, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transfer energy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as the Spitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibrated along the southwest boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. Thus, the proton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than the observed electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburst correspondingly larger as well. We investigate this using a simple one-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. We find that for the thermodynamic parameters of the Cen A shock the electron temperature rises rapidly from ~0.29 keV (the temperature of the ambient ISM) to ~3.5 keV, at which point heating from the protons is balanced by adiabatic losses. The proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in a timescale less than the age of the lobe. We note that the measured electron temperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poor environments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of the shock.","keyword":["Galaxies: Individual: Name: Centaurus A","Galaxies: ISM","Galaxies: Jets","Hydrodynamics","X-Rays: Galaxies","Astrophysics"]}]}}

SN 1978K is a rare example of a Type IIn supernova that has remained bright enough to have long-term X-ray and radio observations. The observations probe the dense medium that was ejected by the progenitor star prior to its explosion; the star might have been a luminous blue variable. The radio imaging shows that the source remains compact, but it may be marginally resolved. The radio monitoring shows deviations from a smooth decay, suggesting that inhomogeneities are present in the radio-emitting region. It appears that a major change occurred in the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star shortly before the supernova event. The X-ray emission between 2000 and 2006 is consistent with the radiation coming from two shocks. All the X-ray data can be fit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-term variability), but this has a surprising requirement: the X-ray-emitting regions have a very large abundance of helium. This would be consistent with the X-ray-emitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by the progenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernova explosion. The unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for an associated gamma-ray burst (GRB). We show that SN 1978K was inside the ~4 σ error box of GRB 771029. If this association is correct, the GRB was exceptionally underluminous.

These periods are thought possibly to represent the orbital periods of close pairs of white dwarfs. In this paper we present optical light curves taken with the high-speed CCD camera ULTRACAM on the 4.2-m William Hershel Telescope in 2003 May and 2005 August and with the VLT in 2005 November. The optical and X-ray light curves of HM Cnc have been reported as being in antiphase, but we find that in fact the X-rays peak around 0.2 cycles after the maximum of the optical light, as seen also in V407 Vul. The X-ray/optical phase shifts are well explained under the accreting models of the systems if most of the optical modulation comes from the heated faces of the mass donors and if the X-ray emitting spots are positioned in advance of the mass donors, as is expected given the angular momentum of the accreting material. Some optical emission may also come from the vicinity of the X-ray spot, and we further show that this can explain the non-sinusoidal light curves of HM Cnc. On the basis of this model we constrain the temperature of the heated face of the companion star finding a bolometric luminosity 〉10<SUP>33</SUP>ergs<SUP>-1</SUP> and a distance, d 〉 1.1 kpc. We can identify no explanation for the X-ray/optical phase shifts under the intermediate polar and unipolar inductor models of the systems.

The variation in position on the sky of a blend of a variable and a constant star can be used as a measure of their separation, and is sensitive to values well below the limit set by seeing. We apply this `pulsation astrometry' to deduce that the G star is separated from the variable by about 0.027 arcsec and hence plays no role in the variability of V407 Vul.

In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin. However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist.

A crucial role in enhancing the asymmetry of the wind absorption suffered by the jet emission is played by the irradiation by X-rays emitted in the vicinity of the black hole. This increases the wind temperature by more than an order of magnitude with respect to that of the wind of an isolated supergiant.

These are fit with model templates providing an estimate of the total infrared luminosity (3-1000μm) of each source. We then exploit the tight correlation between infrared and X-ray luminosities for star-forming galaxies, established in the local Universe, to select sources that are dominated by star formation rather than supermassive black hole accretion. This approach is efficient in discriminating normal galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) over a wide range of star formation rates, from quiescent systems to starbursts. The above methodology results in a sample of 45 X-ray selected star-forming systems at a median redshift z ~ 0.5, the majority of which (60 per cent) are either luminous or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. This sample is least affected by incompleteness and residual AGN contamination and is therefore well suited for cosmological studies.

Such young and moderately massive systems dominate the luminous z ~ 5 LBG population (〉~70 per cent), whereas they comprise 〈~30 per cent of LBG samples at z ~ 3. This result, which we demonstrate is robust under all reasonable modelling assumptions, shows a clear change in the properties of the luminous LBGs between z ~ 5 and z ~ 3. These young and moderately massive z ~ 5 LBGs appear to be experiencing their first (few) generations of large-scale star formation and are accumulating their first significant stellar mass. Their dominance in luminous LBG samples suggests that z ~ 5 witnesses a period of wide-spread, recent galaxy formation. As such, z ~ 5 LBGs are the likely progenitors of the spheroidal components of present-day massive galaxies. This is supported by their high stellar mass surface densities, and is consistent with their core phase-space densities, as well as the ages of stars in the bulge of our Galaxy and other massive systems. With implied formation redshifts of z ~ 6-7, these luminous z ~ 5 LBGs could have only contributed to the UV photon budget at the end of reionization. However, their high star formation rates per unit area suggest these systems host outflows or winds that enrich the intragalactic and intergalactic media with metals, as has been established for z ~ 3 LBGs. Their estimated young ages are consistent with inefficient metal-mixing on galaxy-wide scales. Therefore these galaxies may contain a significant fraction of Population III stars as proposed for z ~ 3 LBGs by Jiminez & Haimann.","keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: formation","galaxies: high-redshift","galaxies: starburst","Astrophysics"]}]}}

In the BZ case, the jets are powered by magnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybrid model, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disc as well as the black hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside and outside the hole's ergosphere. The hybrid model takes advantage of the strengths of both the Blandford-Payne and BZ mechanisms, while avoiding the more controversial features of the latter. We develop these models more fully to account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) for which the jet power is expected to be a significant fraction of the accreted rest mass energy.We apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these models can explain the observed correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the total jet powers. For typical values of the disc viscosity parameter α ~ 0.04 -0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with ADAF model expectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j 〉~ 0.9; that is, it implies that the black holes are rapidly spinning.

The α<SUB>ox</SUB> index that quantifies this ratio is in the range between -0.8 and -1.4, and is below the extrapolation to low luminosities of the relation between α<SUB>ox</SUB> and UV luminosity observed at higher luminosities. In terms of radio loudness, most of the LINERs are indeed radio loud (or sometimes even `super radio loud') based on their radio/UV luminosity ratios, when compared to the most luminous quasars.

Earlier studies assumed a constant bolometric correction for all AGN, and more recent work has suggested accounting for a dependence on AGN luminosity. Until recently, the variations in the disc emission in the ultraviolet (UV) have not been taken into account in this calculation; we show that such variations are important by construction of optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions for 54 AGN.

Populations of AGN such as narrow-line Seyfert 1 nuclei, radio-loud and X-ray-weak AGN may have bolometric corrections which differ systematically from the rest of the AGN population.

These simulations have been performed by implementing a detailed model of chemical evolution in the TREE-PM+SPMGADGET-2 code. This model allows us to follow the metal release from Type II supernovae (SNII), Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by properly accounting for the lifetimes of stars of different mass, as well as to change the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the lifetime function and the stellar yields. As such, our implementation of chemical evolution represents a powerful instrument to follow the cosmic history of metal production. The simulations presented here have been performed with the twofold aim of checking numerical effects, as well as the impact of changing the model of chemical evolution and the efficiency of stellar feedback. In general, we find that the distribution of metals produced by SNII is more clumpy than for the product of low-mass stars, as a consequence of the different time-scales over which they are released. Using a standard Salpeter IMF produces a radial profile of iron abundance which is in fairly good agreement with observations available out to ~=0.6R<SUB>500</SUB>. This result holds almost independent of the numerical scheme adopted to distribute metals around star-forming regions. The mean age of enrichment of the ICM corresponds to redshift z ~ 0.5, which progressively increases outside the virial region. Increasing resolution, we improve the description of a diffuse high-redshift enrichment of the inter-galactic medium (IGM). This turns into a progressively more efficient enrichment of the cluster outskirts, while having a smaller impact at R 〈~ 0.5R<SUB>500</SUB>. As for the effect of the model of chemical evolution, we find that changing the IMF has the strongest impact. Using an IMF, which is top-heavier than the Salpeter one, provides a larger iron abundance, possibly in excess of the observed level, also significantly increasing the [O/Fe] relative abundance. Our simulations always show an excess of low-redshift star formation and, therefore, of the abundance of oxygen in central cluster regions, at variance with observations.

Thus while we confirm the original detection of an extended SZ effect by Myers et al., these X-ray comparisons may now suggest that the central SZ amplitudes detected by WMAP may actually be lower than expected. One possible explanation is that there is contamination of the WMAP SZ signal by radio sources in the clusters but we argue that this appears implausible.

Perhaps most puzzling was the finding that round and slowly rotating objects generally display uncorrelated stellar and gaseous angular momenta, consistent with an external origin for the gas, whereas flatter and fast rotating galaxies host preferentially co-rotating gas and stars, suggesting internal production of gas. Alternatively, a bias against the internal production of ionised gas and against the acquisition of retrograde material may be present in these two kinds of objects, respectively. In light of the different content of hot gas in these systems, with slowly rotating objects being the only systems capable of hosting massive X-ray halos, we suggest that a varying importance of evaporation of warm gas in the hot interstellar medium can contribute to explain the difference in the relative behaviour of gas and stars in these two kinds of objects. Namely, whereas in X-ray bright and slowly rotating galaxies stellar-loss material would quickly evaporate in the hot medium, in X-ray faint and fast rotating objects such material would be allowed to lose angular momentum and settle in a disk, which could also obstruct the subsequent acquisition of retrograde gas.

A high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum in the 3-12keV band was obtained with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) onboard the Suzaku observatory. We found that the spectrum consists of a thermal plasma, a hard power-law tail, and two Gaussian line components.

The two Gaussian lines represent the Kα and Kβ lines from iron at lower ionization stages at ̃ 6.4 and ̃ 7.1 keV. Both the line centers and the intensity ratio of these two lines are consistent with neutral iron. The hard power-law tail with a photon index of ̃0.7 was found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. Compared with the published Chandra spectra constructed separately for point-like and diffuse emission, we conclude that the thermal component is from an ensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at the cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In band-limited images of the XIS field, the distribution of the 7.5-10.0keV emission resembles that of the 6.4keV emission, including local excess at the Arches cluster. This strongly suggests that the power-law emission is related to the 6.4 and 7.1keV lines in the underlying physics. We discuss two ideas to explain both the hard continuum and the lines: (1) X-ray photoionization that produces fluorescence lines and the Thomson scattering continuum and (2) non-thermal electron impact ionization of iron atoms and bremsstrahlung continuum.

We detect the high energy tail with a higher detection significance (6.4σ) than the BeppoSAX claim (2σ). Because of the imaging capabilities of JEM-X and ISGRI, we are able to exclude the possibility that the excess emission comes from very hot regions or absorbed AGN, which proves that the excess emission is indeed of non-thermal origin. Using the available radio data together with the non-thermal hard X-ray flux, we estimate a magnetic field B̃0.1{-}0.2 μ G.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: individual: Ophiuchus","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","gamma rays: observations","Astrophysics"]}]}}

The very good statistics available in the 0.5-10 keV XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum reveals a highly significant deviation from a single power law. A log-parabolic model with a best fit curvature parameter of 0.25 and a peak energy at ~1 keV describes well the spectral shape of the synchrotron emission. The simultaneous fit of Swift UVOT and XRT data provides a milder curvature (b̃0.1) and a peak at higher energies (~15 keV), suggesting a different state of source activity.

By means of a wavelet analysis, this algorithm couples spatially resolved spectroscopy with a structure detection approach. Derived from a former algorithm using Haar wavelets, our algorithm is now implemented with B-spline wavelets in order to perform a more regular analysis of the signal. Compared to other adaptive algorithms, our method has the advantage of analysing spatially the gas temperature structure itself, instead of being primarily driven by the geometry of gas brightness.  <BR />Results: For the four clusters in our sample that are major mergers, we find a rather complex thermal structure with strong thermal variations consistent with their dynamics. For two of them, A2065 and A2256, we perform a 3-d analysis of cold front-like features evidenced from the gas temperature and brightness maps. Furthermore, we detect a significant non-radial thermal structure outside the cool core region of the other 3 more “regular” clusters, with relative amplitudes of about about 10% and typical sizes ranging between 2 and 3 arcmin. We investigate possible implications of this thermal structure on the mass estimates, by extracting the surface brightness and temperature profiles from complementary sectors in the “regular” clusters A1795 and A2029, corresponding to hottest and coldest regions in the maps. For A2029, the temperature and surface brightness gradients seem to compensate each other, leading to a consistent mass profile. For A1795, however, the temperature structure leads to a significant mass discrepancy in the innermost cluster region. The third “regular” cluster, A478, is located in a particular sky region characterised by strong variations of neutral hydrogen column density, Nh, even on angular scales smaller than the cluster itself. For this cluster, we derive a spectroscopic Nh map and investigate the origin of Nh structure by discussing its correlation with galactic emission of dust in the infrared.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: intergalactic","medium","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","techniques: image","processing","techniques: spectroscopic","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We focus particularly on the regions of enhanced X-ray brightness associated with the inner radio lobes, which are known not to be described very well by single-temperature spectral models. Compared to a simple two-temperature fit, we obtain a better and more physical description of the spectra using a model that involves a continuous range of temperatures in each spatial bin. The range of temperatures of the multiphase gas spans ~0.6-3.2 keV. Such a multiphase structure is only possible if thermal conduction is suppressed by magnetic fields. In the multi-temperature regions, we find a correlation between the amount of cool gas (with a temperature below that of the surrounding X-ray plasma) and the metallicity, and conclude that the cool gas is more metal-rich than the ambient halo. In the frame of the assumed thermal model, we estimate the average Fe abundance of the cool gas to ~2.2 solar. Our results thus point toward the key role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in transporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium through the uplift of cool, metal-rich gas from the galaxy. However, the abundance ratios of O/Si/S/Fe in and outside the X-ray arms are similar, indicating that the dominant fraction of metals in the gas halo was uplifted by AGN outbursts relatively recently compared to the age of M 87. Our best estimate for the mass of the cool gas is 5×10<SUP>8</SUP> M_☉, which probably stems from a mixture of ICM, stellar mass loss, and Type Ia supernova products. ≈30-110 Myr are required to produce the observed metals in the cool gas.

The scaling relations based solely on the X-ray data (S-T, S-Y_X, P-Y_X, M-T, M-Y_X, M-M_gas, M_gas-T, L-T, L-Y_X, and L-M) obey empirical self-similarity and reveal no additional evolution beyond the large-scale structure growth. They also reveal up to 17 per cent segregation between all 37 clusters and non-cool core clusters. Weak lensing mass measurements are also available in the literature for 19 of the clusters with XMM-Newton data. The average of the weak lensing mass to X-ray based mass ratio is 1.09± 0.08, setting the limit of the non-thermal pressure support to 9 ± 8 per cent. The mean of the weak lensing mass to X-ray based mass ratio of these clusters is ~1, indicating good agreement between X-ray and weak lensing masses for most clusters, although with 31-51 per cent scatter.

With the increasing prospect of performing astronomical XAS observations, there is much to be gained from applying these techniques to laboratory analogues.   <BR />Aims: Diagnostic markers for medium-range order and the effect of thermal annealing on these in amorphous silicates of differing Mg content are characterised using synchrotron X-ray methods. <BR />Methods: Three synthetic amorphous silicates with high, medium and low Mg:Si ratios were annealed at varying temperatures up to 1300 K.

Based on changes to the morphological details of the XANES spectra, the medium-range structure changes between an enstatite-like and forsterite-like coordination with increasing temperature and appears to correlate directly with Mg content. Low wavevector X-ray scattering features were also found to be diagnostic of the type of medium-range structural ordering.

Utilising the optical to X-ray flux ratios, a rough correction was applied for the ~8% redshift incompleteness still present in the sample. Then the fraction of absorbed sources was determined as a function of X-ray luminosity and redshift.  <BR />Results: The absorbed fraction decreases strongly with X-ray luminosity. This can be represented by an almost linear decrease from ~80% to ~20% in the luminosity range log L_X= 42-46 and is consistent with similar derivations in the optical and MIR bands. Several methods are used to study a possible evolution of the absorption fraction. The absorbed fraction increases significantly with redshift, which can be described by a power-law with a slope ~(1+z)<SUP>0.62 ± 0.11</SUP>, saturating at a redshift of z ̃ 2.

We cross-match the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) with galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) to create such a sample. Because of the high SDSS source density and large RASS positional errors, the cross-matched catalog is highly contaminated by random associations. We investigate the overlap of these surveys and provide a statistical test of the validity of RASS-SDSS galaxy cross-matches. The SDSS quasars provide a test of our cross-match validation scheme, as they have a very high fraction of true RASS matches. We find that the number of true matches between the SDSS main galaxy sample and the RASS is highly dependent on the optical spectral classification of the galaxy; essentially no star-forming galaxies are detected, while more than 0.6% of narrow-line Seyferts are detected in the RASS. Also, galaxies with ambiguous optical classification have a surprisingly high RASS detection fraction. This allows us to further constrain the SEDs of low-luminosity active galaxies.

Such a result has implications for both the single-star and binary accretion/merger models for the progenitor of SNR 1987A. In the context of the binary merger scenario proposed by Morris & Podsiadlowski, material forming the inner, equatorial ring was expelled after the merger, implying that either our derived Fe abundance is inconsistent with typical LMC values or that iron is underabundant at the site of the progenitor star of SNR 1987A.","keyword":["circumstellar matter","methods: data analysis","plasmas","shock waves","supernovae: individual: SN 1987A","supernova remnants","X-rays: individual: SN 1987A","Astrophysics"]}]}}

However, in the M87/Virgo cluster, where cavities are less prominent, X-ray observations show a 30 kpc long nearly radial filament of relatively cooler gas that projects from the cluster core into a large (40 kpc) radio lobe. We describe the dynamical relationship between these two very dissimilar observations with gas dynamical calculations that include the dynamical effects and spatial diffusion of cosmic rays. After cosmic rays inflate the cavity, they diffuse through the cavity walls, forming a much larger lobe. The cavities, which are most visible just after they have formed (in about 20 Myr), require a total cosmic ray energy that is more than 10 times larger than that usually assumed, E = 4PV. During the relatively brief cavity lifetime, a jetlike, low-entropy thermal filament is formed in the buoyant flow and moves at high subsonic velocities through the cavity center and beyond. After 100 million years, long after the cavity has disappeared, the relatively dense filament extends to 20-30 kpc and the cosmic rays have diffused into a quasi-spherical lobe 40 kpc in diameter. These computed X-ray and radio features agree well with those observed in M87/Virgo and resemble those in other \"relic\" cluster radio sources such as Abell 13 and Abell 133. Eventually, the filament falls back and shocks at the center of the cluster (perhaps stimulating the famous nonthermal M87 jet), and only the aging radio lobe remains.","keyword":["cooling flows","galaxies: clusters: general","X-rays: galaxies","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics"]}]}}

SDSS J0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before. The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission with a broad base, narrow core, and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong He II emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have faded away significantly in new spectra taken in 2007 December. Comparison of SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the NUV, optical, and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be explained by a giant outburst in the EUV-X-ray band, detected even in the optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, helium, and Balmer lines represent the \"light echo\" of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear material.

However, technically, it is a difficult task to calculate the global solution because of the transonic nature of the flow, which makes it a two-point boundary value problem. In this paper we propose a simplified approach for calculating the global ADAF solution. We replace the radial momentum equation by a simple algebraic relation between the angular velocity of the gas and the Keplerian angular velocity while keeping all other equations unchanged. It is then easy to solve the differential energy equations to obtain an approximate global solution. By adjusting the free parameters, we find that for almost any accretion rate and for α = 0.1-0.3 we can get good simplified global solutions.

In this paper we present new high-resolution HST ACS and Chandra X-ray data. The high resolution and sensitivity of ACS enabled us to detect and quantify several new multiple images; we use a total of eight for the strong-lensing analysis.

We concentrate on the different types of interaction between the inflowing wind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when accretion of matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these include inhibition through the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. Expanding on earlier work, we calculate the expected luminosity for each regime and derive the conditions under which transition from one regime to another can take place. We show that very large luminosity swings (~10<SUP>4</SUP> or more on timescales as short as hours) can result from transitions across different regimes. The activity displayed by supergiant fast X-ray transients, a recently discovered class of high-mass X-ray binaries in our galaxy, has often been interpreted in terms of direct accretion onto a neutron star immersed in an extremely clumpy stellar wind. We show here that the transitions across the magnetic and/or centrifugal barriers can explain the variability properties of these sources as a result of relatively modest variations in the stellar wind velocity and/or density. According to this interpretation we expect that supergiant fast X-ray transients which display very large luminosity swings and host a slowly spinning neutron star are characterized by magnetar-like fields, irrespective of whether the magnetic or the centrifugal barrier applies. Supergiant fast X-ray transients might thus provide a new opportunity to detect and study magnetars in binary systems.","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","stars: neutron","supergiants","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics"]}]}}

Because of their higher space velocities, low-mass X-ray binaries are more likely to leave trails than high-mass X-ray binaries. We show that the volume of radio plasma released by microquasars over the history of the Galaxy is comparable to the disk volume, and argue that a fraction of a few percent of the radio plasma left behind by the X-ray binary is likely mixed with the neutral phases of the ISM before the plasma is removed from the disk by buoyancy.

Previous studies found no differences in flaring between disk-free and accreting systems other than a small overall diminution of X-ray luminosity in accreting systems. The most important finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating disk-free stars can significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop sizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This is consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction in which the inner disk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere.

Since only a small number of DOGs are individually detected at far-IR and submillimeter wavelengths, we use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects and plot a composite IR (8-1000 μm) spectral energy distribution (SED). The average luminosity of these star-forming DOGs is L<SUB>IR</SUB> ~ 1 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>.

The far-IR SED shape of DOGs is similar to that of SMGs (average dust temperature of around 30 K), but DOGs have a higher mid-IR-to-far-IR flux ratio.

Although they are centrally localized, these abundance peaks have a broader profile than the stars of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) that produce the excess iron, indicating that metal-enriched plasma is transported out of the BCG by some process such as turbulent diffusion. The AGN-driven convection model of Chandran & Rasera predicts the turbulent velocity profile in a steady state cluster in which radiative cooling is balanced by heating from AGN-driven convection and thermal conduction. We use the velocity profiles from this model as input into an advection/diffusion model for the transport of metals in the intracluster medium. We compare the results of our model to XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of eight clusters. Assuming a constant turbulence level over a cluster's lifetime equal to the present value, the turbulent velocities in the model can explain the observed abundance profiles in only five of the eight clusters. However, we go on to develop an analytic fit of the turbulent velocity profile as a function of the AGN power.

Due to the enigmatic nature of this object, hidden inside the strong stellar wind of its Wolf-Rayet companion, it has remained unclear whether this state represents an intrinsic hard state, with truncation of the inner disc, or whether it is just a result of increased local absorption. We study the X-ray light curves from RXTE/ASM and CGRO/BATSE in terms of distributions and correlations of flux and hardness and find several signs of a bimodal behaviour of the accretion flow that are not likely to be the result of increased absorption in a surrounding medium.

Yet relatively little attention has been given to the origins of this apparent dichotomy and, in particular, to the energetics and thermal histories of the two classes. We develop a model for the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configuration established by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. At large radii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and their scalings well. However, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling and gravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles of either CC or NCC clusters. The inferred entropy profiles of NCC clusters require that material is `pre-heated' prior to cluster collapse in order to explain the absence of low-entropy (cool) material in these systems. We show that a similar modification is also required in CC clusters in order to match their entropy profiles at intermediate radii. In CC clusters, this modification is unstable, and an additional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a few keV. We show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback loop in which the lowest entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated and rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. The resulting model does not require fine-tuning and is in excellent agreement with a wide variety of observational data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, including entropy and gas density profiles, the luminosity-temperature relation and high-resolution spectra. The spread in cluster core morphologies is seen to arise because of the steep dependence of the central cooling time on the initial level of pre-heating. Some of the other implications of this model are briefly discussed.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","cooling flows","cosmology: theory","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics"]}]}}

The discrimination diagnostics include radio morphology, radio spectral index, radio/near-infrared (near-IR) and mid-IR/radio flux density ratios. We are now able to calculate the extragalactic Euclidean normalized source counts separately for AGN and SFGs. We find that while SFGs dominate at the faintest flux densities and account for the majority of the upturn in the counts, AGN still make up around one quarter of the counts at ~50μJy (1.4GHz). Using radio luminosity as an unobscured star formation rate (SFR) measure we are then able to examine the comoving SFR density of the Universe up to z = 3 which agrees well with measures at other wavelengths. We find a rough correlation of SFR with stellar mass for both the sample presented here and a sample of local radio-selected SFGs from the 6df-NVSS survey. This work also confirms the existence of, and provides alternative evidence for, the evolution of distribution of star formation by galaxy mass: `downsizing'. As both these samples are SFR-selected, this result suggests that there is a maximum SFR for a given galaxy that depends linearly on its stellar mass. The low `characteristic times' (inverse specific SFR) of the SFGs in our sample are similar to those of the 6dF-NVSS sample, implying that most of these sources are in a current phase of enhanced star formation.","keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: starburst","radio continuum: galaxies","Astrophysics"]}]}}

As with previous studies, we find that FRI radio galaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitude in bolometric X-ray luminosity; however, we find no evidence for a tight relationship between large-scale X-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size, radio luminosity and axial ratio. This leads us to conclude that radio-source evolution cannot be determined entirely by the global properties of the hot gas. We confirm earlier work showing that equipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the external pressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particles must be present. We present the first direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missing pressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure and apparent pressure imbalance. Finally, our study provides further support for the presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared to the group population as a whole. For five of eight temperature excesses, the energy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy required to produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases the current radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. It remains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated with the current phase of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, or whether it is instead either a signature of previous AGN activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of group properties most conducive to the growth of an FRI radio galaxy.","keyword":["galaxies: active","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We investigate the X-ray morphology and derive the most likely impact parameters, mass ratios and initial relative velocities. We find that the observed displacement between the X-ray peaks and the associated mass distribution, the morphology of the bow shock, the surface brightness and projected temperature profiles across the shock discontinuity can be well reproduced by offset 6:1 encounters where the subcluster has initial velocity (in the rest frame of the main cluster) 2.3 times the virial velocity of the main cluster dark matter halo. A model with the same mass ratio and lower velocity (1.5 times the main cluster virial velocity) matches quite well most of the observations. However, it does not reproduce the relative surface brightness between the bullet and the main cluster. Dynamical friction strongly affects the kinematics of the subcluster so that the low-velocity bullet is actually bound to the main system at the end of the simulation. We find that a relatively high concentration (c = 6) of the main cluster dark matter halo is necessary in order to prevent the disruption of the associated X-ray peak.

This is partly because AGN are hosted by red luminous galaxies, which are known to reside, on average, in dense environments.

There is also tentative evidence, significant at the 98 per cent level, that the field produces more X-ray luminous AGN compared to groups, extending similar results at low redshift to z ~ 1.

Motivated by recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we propose a scheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surface brightness and entropy profiles. Three dominant morphologies emerge: two hosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool [CCC (compact cool core) systems] or warm [CWC (compact warm core) systems] and one hosting extended cores which are warm [EWC (extended warm core) systems]. In the cases we have studied, CCC states are disrupted only after direct collisions with merging cluster cores. This can happen in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage in off-axis mergers. By the time they are relaxed, our remnant cores have generally been heated to warm core (CWC or EWC) states but subsequently recover CCC states by the end of the simulation. The only case resulting in a long-lived EWC state is a slightly off-axis 3:1 merger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of a low-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the secondary's cool core. Since t<SUB>dyn</SUB> 〈〈 t<SUB>cool</SUB> for all our relaxing merger remnant cores, compression prevents their core temperatures from falling until after they relax to the compact states allowed by their remnant central entropies. This naturally explains the population of relaxed CWC systems observed in recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations with no need to invoke active galactic nuclei feedback. The morphological segregation in the L<SUB>x</SUB>-T<SUB>x</SUB> scaling relation noted by McCarthy et al. is qualitatively reflected in the results of our mergers as well. However, none of the cases we have studied produces systems with sufficiently high central entropies to account for the most underluminous EWC systems observed. Lastly, mergers do not efficiently mix the intracluster medium in our simulations. As a result, merging systems which initially host central metallicity gradients do not yield merger remnants with flat metallicity profiles. Taken together, these results suggest that once formed, compact core systems are remarkably stable against disruption from mergers. It remains to be demonstrated exactly how the sizable observed population of extended core systems was formed.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","intergalactic medium","cosmology: theory","X-rays: general","Astrophysics"]}]}}

An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach 10<SUP>12</SUP> K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their temperature typically capped at ̃10 K. The foundational papers predicted that the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as later observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest, however, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the accretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as the gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes in the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a comparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which reside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on average observed to be fainter by a factor of ̃100-1000. The natural explanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy from its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event horizon.

The number of SNRs in the survey area is 21, which is about ahalf of the known LMC SNRs. We systematically examined AKARI images and identified eight SNRs with distinguishable infrared emission.

In the 11 / 15 μm versus 15 / 24 μm color-color diagram, the SNRs appear to be aligned along amodified blackbody curve, representing thermal emission from dust at temperatures of between 90 and 190K. There is agood correlation between the 24 μm and X-ray fluxes of the SNRs. It was also found that there is agood correlation between the 24 μm and radio fluxes even if there is no direct physical connection between them. We considered the origin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual SNRs. We conclude that the mid-infrared emissions in five SNRs that show morphologies similar to the X-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by X-ray emitting plasma. Their 15 / 24 μm color temperatures are generally higher than the Spitzer 24 / 70 μm color temperatures, which suggests that asingle-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energy distribution (SED) of the SNRs.

To accurately determine the intrinsic (before absorption) X-ray luminosity function, it is essential to constrain the evolutionary properties of AGN and therefore the history of the formation of supermassive black holes with cosmic time.  <BR />Methods: In this paper we investigate the X-ray luminosity function of absorbed (log N<SUB>H</SUB> 〉 22) and unabsorbed AGN in three energy bands (soft: 0.5-2 keV, hard: 2-10 keV and ultrahard: 4.5-7.5 keV). For the hard and ultrahard sources we have also studied the N<SUB>H</SUB> function and the dependence of the fraction of absorbed AGN on luminosity and redshift. This investigation is carried out using the XMS survey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallower surveys in all three bands for a total of 1009, 435, and 119 sources in the soft, hard and ultrahard bands, respectively. We modelled the instrinsic absorption of the hard and ultrahard sources (N<SUB>H</SUB> function) and computed the X-ray luminosity function in all bands using two methods. The first makes use of a modified version of the classic 1/V<SUB>a</SUB> technique, while the second performs a maximum likelihood (ML) fit using an analytic model and all available sources without binning.  <BR />Results: We find that the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is best described by a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) model. Our results show good overall agreement with previous results in the hard band, although with slightly weaker evolution. Our model in the soft band present slight discrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day XLF being significantly flatter. We find faster evolution in the AGN detected in the ultrahard band than those in the hard band. <BR />Conclusions: The results reported here show that the fraction of absorbed AGN in the hard and ultrahard bands is dependent on the X-ray luminosity. We find evidence that this fraction evolves with redshift in the hard band, whereas there is none in the ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. Our best-fit XLF shows that the high-luminosity AGN, detected in all bands, exhibit a similar behaviours and are fully formed earlier than the less luminous AGN. The latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretion rate and mass density of the Universe, according to an anti-hierarchical black hole growth scenario.","keyword":["surveys","X-rays: general","cosmology: observations","galaxies: active","Astrophysics"]}]}}

We explore possible diagnostics of the early blast wave and of the circumstellar medium (CSM) in which the explosion occurred.  <BR />Methods: We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the blast wave from the 2006 outburst, propagating through the inhomogeneous CSM. The model takes into account the thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation) and the radiative cooling. From the simulations, we synthesize the X-ray emission and derive the spectra as they would be observed with Chandra/HETG.  <BR />Results: The simulated nova remnant is highly aspherical and the blast wave is efficiently collimated by the inhomogeneous CSM. Our model reproduces the observed X-ray emission in a natural way if the CSM in which the outburst occurred is characterized by an equatorial density enhancement. Our “best-fit” model predicts that most of the early X-ray emission originates from a small region propagating in the direction perpendicular to the line-of-sight and localized just behind the interaction front between the blast wave and the equatorial density enhancement. The model predicts asymmetric and blue-shifted line profiles remarkably similar to those observed. These asymmetries are due to substantial X-ray absorption of red-shifted emission by ejecta material.  <BR />Conclusions: The comparison of high quality data of Chandra/HETG with detailed hydrodynamic modeling has allowed us to unveil, for the first time, the details of the structure emitting in the X-ray band in early phases of the outburst evolution, contributing to a better understanding of the physics of interactions between nova blasts and CSM in recurrent novae.

The same trend is observed between L<SUB>R</SUB> and the classical mass deposition rate, dot{M}<SUB>classical</SUB> in SCC and partly also in WCC clusters, and can be quantified as L<SUB>R</SUB>∝ dot{M}<SUB>classical</SUB><SUP>1.69±0.25</SUP>.

To this end, we use the 2MASS K-band magnitudes and invoke the near-infrared bulge luminosity-black hole mass relation to convert L<SUB>BCG</SUB> to supermassive black hole mass, M<SUB>BH</SUB>. We find a weak correlation between M<SUB>BH</SUB> and L<SUB>R</SUB> for SCC clusters, L<SUB>R</SUB>̃ M<SUB>BH</SUB><SUP>4.10 ± 0.42</SUP>, although with a few outliers. We find an excellent correlation of L<SUB>BCG</SUB> with M<SUB>{500</SUB>} and L<SUB>X</SUB> for the entire sample, the SCC clusters showing a tighter trend in both the cases. We discuss the plausible reasons behind these scaling relations in the context of cooling flows and AGN feedback. Our results strongly suggest an AGN-feedback machinery in SCC clusters, which regulates the cooling in the central regions. Since the dispersion in these correlations, such as that between L<SUB>R</SUB> and dot{M}<SUB>classical</SUB> or L<SUB>R</SUB> and M<SUB>BH</SUB>, increases in going from SCC to WCC clusters, we conclude there must be secondary processes that work either in conjunction with the AGN heating or independently to counteract the radiative losses in WCC clusters.Table 1 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org","keyword":["cooling flows","galaxies: active","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","radio continuum: galaxies","galaxies: clusters: general","Astrophysics"]}]}}

In June 2006 a magnetar-like outburst took place. Using multi-year RXTE and INTEGRAL observations covering the epoch of the outburst, we aim to study the temporal and spectral characteristics of PSR J1846-0258 over a broad ~3-300 keV energy range to derive constraints on theoretical scenarios aiming to explain this schizophrenic behaviour.  <BR />Methods: We explored all publically available RXTE observations of PSR J1846-0258 to generate accurate ephemerides over the period January 30, 2000-November 7, 2007. Phase-folding procedures yielded pulse profiles for RXTE PCA (~3-30 keV), RXTE HEXTE (~15-250 keV) and INTEGRAL ISGRI (~20-300 keV). The pulsed spectrum over the full ~3-300 keV energy range was derived, as well as the total spectrum (including the pulsar wind nebula) over the 20-300 keV band with the ISGRI. The timing, spatial, and spectral analyses were applied for epochs before, during, and after the magnetar-like outburst to study the evolution of the high-energy characteristics.  <BR />Results: ISGRI detected PSR J1846-0258/Kes-75 before outburst during 2003-2006 with a power-law-shape spectrum over the 20-300 keV energy range with photon index Γ = 1.80±0.06 and energy flux (20-300 keV) of (6.62± 0.35)× 10<SUP>-11</SUP> erg/cm<SUP>2</SUP> s. More than 90 days after the onset of the outburst, still during the decay phase, the same spectral shape was measured (Γ = 1.75<SUB>-0.31</SUB><SUP>+0.27</SUP>) with an indication for a 52% (2.3σ) enhanced total emission, while one year after the outburst the hard X-ray non-thermal emission of PSR J1846-0258/Kes-75 was found to be back to its pre-outburst values. PCA monitoring of PSR J1846-0258 before the outburst yielded phase-coherent ephemerides confirming the earlier derived breaking index of the spindown. During the outburst, incoherent solutions have been derived. We show that the radiative outburst was triggered by a major spin-up glitch near MJD 53 883± 3 with a glitch size Δν/ν in the range (2.0-4.4)× 10<SUP>-6</SUP>. Using all pre-outburst observations of ISGRI and HEXTE for the first time pulse profiles have been obtained up to 150 keV with a broad single asymmetric pulse. The pulse shape did not vary with energy over the 2.9-150 keV energy range, nor did it change during the magnetar-like outburst. The time-averaged pre-outburst ~3-300 keV pulsed spectrum measured with the PCA, HEXTE, and ISGRI was fitted with a power-law model with Γ = 1.20± 0.01. A fit with a curved power-law model gives an improved fit. Around 150 keV the pulsed fraction approaches 100%. For the first 32 days of the magnetar-like outburst, the 3-30 keV pulsed spectrum can be represented with two power laws, a soft component with index Γ<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.96± 0.06 and a hard component with the pre-outburst value Γ<SUB>h</SUB> ̃ 1.2. Above ~9 keV, all spectra during outburst are consistent with the latter single power-law shape with index ~1.2. The 2-10 keV flux increased by a factor ~5 and the 10-30 keV flux increased with only 35%. After ~120 days the soft outburst and the enhancement of the hard non-thermal component both vanish.  <BR />Conclusions: The varying temporal and spectral characteristics of PSR J1846-0258 can be explained in a scenario of a young high-B-field pulsar in which a major glitch triggered a sudden release of energy. Resonant cyclotron upscattering could subsequently generate the decaying/cooling soft pulsed component measured during outburst between 3 and 10 keV. The (variation in the) non-thermal hard X-ray component can be explained with synchrotron emission in a slot-gap or outer-gap pulsar model.","keyword":["pulsars: individual: PSR J1846-0258","pulsars: individual: PSR B1509-58","pulsars: individual: 4U 0142+61","pulsars: individual: 1RXS J170849-400910","X-rays: general","gamma rays: observations"]}]}}

In all observations a slit width of 0.4 arcsec was used to obtain a spectral resolving power of R ≈ 2000.   <BR />Results: Among the 21 Herbig Ae/Be stars studied, new detections of a magnetic field were achieved in six stars. For three Herbig Ae/Be stars, we confirm previous magnetic field detections.

No field detection at a significance level of 3σ was achieved in stars with debris disks. Our study does not indicate any correlation of the strength of the longitudinal magnetic field with disk orientation, disk geometry, or the presence of a companion. We also do not see any simple dependence on the mass-accretion rate. However, it is likely that the range of observed field values qualitatively supports the expectations from magnetospheric accretion models giving support for dipole-like field geometries. Both the magnetic field strength and the X-ray emission show hints of a decline with age in the range of ~2-14 Myr probed by our sample, supporting a dynamo mechanism that decays with age. However, our study of rotation does not show any obvious trend of the strength of the longitudinal magnetic field with rotation period.

Dynamical friction as the driving process leads to the coalescence of individual galaxies in ordinary poor groups leaving behind nothing more than a central, massive elliptical galaxy supposed to contain the merger history of the whole group. Due to merging timescales for less-massive galaxies and gas cooling timescales of the X-ray intragroup medium exceeding a Hubble time, a surrounding faint-galaxy population having survived this galactic cannibalism as well as an extended X-ray halo similar to that found in ordinary groups, is expected. Recent studies suggest that fossil groups are very abundant and could be the progenitors of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the centers of rich galaxy clusters. However, only a few objects are known to the literature. This article aims to summarize the results of observational fossil group research over the last few years and presents ongoing work by the authors. Complementary to previous research, the SDSS and RASS surveys have been cross-correlated to identify new fossil structures yielding 34 newly detected fossil group candidates. Observations with ISIS at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma have been carried out to study the stellar populations of the central ellipticals of 6 fossil groups.

Of these, 45% are best fit by simple power law models, while 55% require the more complex partial covering model. One of our goals was to determine the fraction of \"hidden\" AGNs, which we define as sources with scattering fractions less than or equal to 0.03 and ratios of soft to hard X-ray flux less than or equal to 0.04. We found that \"hidden\" AGNs constitute a high percentage of the sample (24%), proving that they are a very significant portion of local AGNs.

By construction, our galaxy models obey the stellar mass-size relation initially. Also, we study both galaxy models with adiabatically contracted and uncompressed halos. We demonstrate that the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) evolves away from the Kormendy relation as defined by the smaller mass galaxies (i.e., the relation bends). This is accompanied by a significantly faster dark matter mass growth within the half-light radius of the BCG compared to the increase in the stellar mass inside the same radius. As a result of the comparatively large number of mergers the BCG experiences, its total mass-to-light ratio becomes significantly higher than in typical elliptical galaxies. We also show that the mixing processes between dark matter and stars lead to a small but numerically robust tilt in the fundamental plane and that the BCG lies on the tilted plane. Our model is consistent with the observed steepening of the logarithmic mass-to-light gradient as a function of the stellar mass. As we have not included effects from gas dynamics or star formation, these trends are exclusively due to N-body and stellar dynamical effects. Surprisingly, we find only tentative weak distortion in the Faber-Jackson relation that depends on the aperture size, unlike expected based on studies of isolated merger simulations. This may be due to differences in the distribution of galaxy orbits, which is given in our approach directly by the cosmological context while it has to be assumed in isolated merger simulations, and the fact that the BCG is located deep in the cluster potential well. Another uncertainty in both approaches lies in the definition of the spatial extent of the BCG.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular","cD","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

We find that the population of submillijansky radio sources with X-ray counterparts is composed of a mix of roughly 1/3 star-forming galaxies and 2/3 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The distribution of intrinsic absorption among X-ray-detected radio sources is different from that of the X-ray-selected sample. Namely, the fraction of low-absorption sources is at least 2 times larger than that of X-ray selected sources in the CDFS.

This argues against the use of radio surveys as an efficient way to search for the missing population of strongly absorbed AGNs.

For example, it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by Bode & Phinney is that because radiation of gravitational waves during the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness of the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely. However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable. This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk. Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future X-ray instrument with a field of view of the order of a square degree, or possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","black hole physics","galaxies: nuclei","gravitational waves","relativity","Astrophysics"]}]}}

Column densities at hard energies (2-10 keV) seem to be much higher than what would be expected from the optical extinction. They might be associated with the inner regions of the AGN, buried at optical wavelengths. The main result of this paper is that around 50% of our LINER sample shows signatures of Compton-thickness according to the most common tracers: the X-ray spectral index, F_{X}(2-10 keV)/F([O III]) ratio, and FeKα equivalent width (EW). However, the EWs of the Compton-thick LINERs are significantly lower than in the Compton-thick Seyferts (sime200 eV against 〉=500 eV), suggesting that the 2-10 keV emission is dominated by electron scattering of the otherwise invisible AGN, or by emission from shocked gas associated with star formation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. However, no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes and X-ray classified Compton-thick objects. This may suggest that Compton-thick sources should be related to absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the AGN, maybe in the putative dusty torus. Larger black hole masses and lower Eddington ratios than Seyfert galaxies have been found. This effect can be better attributed to LINER nuclei being hosted by earlier morphological types than Seyfert nuclei. However, it has to be noted that, once a proper correction to the X-ray luminosity is applied, LINERs show Eddington ratios overlapping those of type 2 Seyferts.

Here, we report a study on M101-ULX1 with 26 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations and 33 X-ray observations over 16 years. There were three multi-band HST observations at different optical states over eight years, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of which cannot be fitted by the previously claimed secondary of a B supergiant or any other single star. All SEDs can be decomposed into the same stellar component plus a second component due to X-ray irradiation with different contributions at different optical states. The secondary in ULX1 is most likely a WR star as revealed by the SED decompositions and confirmed by the presence of He II λ4686 emission in the counterpart spectrum. Five X-ray outbursts and two optical peaks are revealed from X-ray and optical light curves, and optical peaks are identified as the optical response to X-ray outbursts. The correlated optical and X-ray variability analysis is suggestive of ellipsoidal modulation with a half-amplitude of 0.05 mag and a period in the range of 1.5-4.5 days. Future photometric and spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the orbital period and measure the dynamical mass for ULX1.","keyword":["galaxies: individual: M101","X-rays: binaries"]}]}}

Based on the gravitational wells set by the dark matter (DM) halos, the SM straightforwardly expresses the equilibrium of the intracluster plasma (ICP) modulated by the entropy deposited at the boundary by standing shocks from gravitational accretion, and injected at the center by outgoing blast waves from mergers or from outbursts of active galactic nuclei. The cluster set analyzed here highlights not only how simply the SM represents the main dichotomy CC versus NCC clusters in terms of a few ICP parameters governing the radial entropy run, but also how accurately it fits even complex brightness and temperature profiles. For CC clusters like A2199 and A2597, the SM with a low level of central entropy straightforwardly yields the characteristic peaked profile of the temperature marked by a decline toward the center, without requiring currently strong radiative cooling and high mass deposition rates. NCC clusters like A1656 require instead a central entropy floor of a substantial level, and some like A2256 and even more A644 feature structured temperature profiles that also call for a definite floor extension; in such conditions the SM accurately fits the observations, and suggests that in these clusters the ICP has been just remolded by a merger event, in the way of a remnant cool core. The SM also predicts that DM halos with high concentration should correlate with flatter entropy profiles and steeper brightness in the outskirts; this is indeed the case with A1689, for which from X-rays we find concentration values c ~ 10, the hallmark of an early halo formation. Thus, we show the SM to constitute a fast tool not only to provide wide libraries of accurate fits to X-ray temperature and density profiles, but also to retrieve from the ICP archives specific information concerning the physical histories of DM and baryons in the inner and the outer cluster regions.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: individual: A2199 A2597 A1689 A2256 A644","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

This paradox can be resolved by intermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released near the black hole.

We have used spectroscopic redshifts and classifications from the literature, where available, and photometric redshifts for the remainder.

The optical and infrared data have been modelled in terms of our well-established optical galaxy and quasi-stellar object templates, and infrared templates based on radiative transfer models. This type of analysis gives better insight into the infrared spectral energy distributions, and a better separation of the contribution of starbursts and AGN dust tori, than a simple comparison of 24 μm to optical or X-ray fluxes. We also believe this gives more insight than using a library of fixed ultraviolet-infrared templates.Our estimate of the N(H) distribution is consistent with other studies, but we do find a higher proportion of low absorption objects at z 〈 0.5 than at z 〉 0.5.

Therefore, we propose an alternative scenario where the emission of at least two independent compact components is observed at the same time. <BR /> Methods: We compare two different models. The first model assumes the injection of relativistic particles into a downstream region of a shock wave inside a jet that creates the emitting source.

Using nonparametric methods which combine weak and strong lensing data, the projected masses within R<SUB>200</SUB> can be constrained with a precision of ~10%.

This paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from the molecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (CND) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Unlike in other active galaxies, the intensely star-forming regions in NGC 1068 and the CND can be resolved with current instrumentation. This makes this galaxy an optimal test-bed to probe the effects of AGN on the molecular medium at ~100 pc scales. <BR /> Aims: Single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of silicon monoxide (SiO) in the CND of NGC 1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude with respect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in the Galaxy. We aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the SiO enhancement. <BR /> Methods: We have imaged the emission of the SiO(2-1) (86.8 GHz) and CN(2-1) (226.8 GHz) lines in NGC 1068 at ~150 pc and 60 pc spatial resolution with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI). We have also obtained complementary IRAM 30 m observations of HNCO and methanol (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH) lines. These species are known as tracers of shocks in the Galaxy. <BR /> Results: SiO is detected in a disk of ~400 pc size around the AGN. SiO abundances in the CND of ~(1-5) × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> are about 1-2 orders of magnitude above those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the CND is high: ~(0.2-1) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP>. The abundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the extreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN (r 〈 70 pc). On average, HNCO/SiO and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH/SiO line ratios in the CND are similar to those measured in prototypical shocked regions in our Galaxy. Yet the strength and abundance of CN in NGC 1068 can be explained neither by shocks nor by photon-dominated region (PDR) chemistry. Abundances measured for CN and SiO and the correlation of CN/CO and SiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation suggest that the CND of NGC 1068 has become a giant X-ray-dominated region (XDR). <BR /> Conclusions: The extreme properties of molecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC 1068 result from the interplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity. The results presented here highlight in particular the footprint of shocks and X-ray irradiation on the properties of molecular gas in this Seyfert. Whereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC 1068, the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. The inclusion of dust grain chemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of other molecular species, like HCN, which are under-predicted by XDR models.Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the resistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among solar-mass T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variations in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity, but can plausibly be produced by varying these parameters together with the disk magnetic flux. The diverse shapes and strengths of the mid-infrared silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magnetorotational turbulence, through the following three effects. First, recombination on grains 1 μm or smaller yields a magnetically inactive dead zone extending more than two scale heights from the midplane, while turbulent motions in the magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoot the dead zone boundary by only about one scale height. Second, grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically in wave motions driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the rates found in laminar flow, so that the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk atmosphere will become dust-depleted unless resupplied from elsewhere. Third, with sufficient depletion, the dead zone is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The last of these processes enables evolutionary signatures such as the degree of settling to sometimes decrease with age. The MHD results also show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of small grains into the atmosphere. Consequently the photosphere height changes by up to one-third over timescales of a few orbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface varies by factors of 2 over times down to a tenth of an orbit. We suggest that the changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the daily to monthly mid-infrared variability found in many young stars.","keyword":["circumstellar matter","instabilities","MHD","solar system: formation","stars: formation","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

The extensive radio polarization allows us to image in detail the intrinsic magnetic field, which is well-ordered and reveals that a number of loop-like filaments are strongly magnetized. In addition, we determine that there are both radial and toroidal components to the magnetic field structure of the PWN. Strong mid-infrared (IR) emission detected in Spitzer Space Telescope data is closely correlated with the radio emission arising from the southern edge of G54.1+0.3. In particular, the distributions of radio and X-ray emission compared with the mid-IR emission suggest that the PWN may be interacting with this interstellar cloud. This may be the first PWN where we are directly detecting its interplay with an interstellar cloud that has survived the impact of the supernova explosion associated with the pulsar's progenitor.","keyword":["ISM: individual objects: G54.1+0.3","ISM: supernova remnants","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

These discoveries increase the total sample of massive stellar X-ray sources in the Galactic center region to 30 (possibly 31). For the majority of these sources, the X-ray photometry is consistent with thermal emission from plasma having temperatures in the range of kT = 1-8 keV or non-thermal emission having power-law indices in the range of -1 〈~ Γ 〈~ 3, and X-ray luminosities in the range of L <SUB>X</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>32</SUP>-10<SUP>34</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.5-8.0 keV). Several sources have exhibited X-ray variability of several factors between observations. These X-ray properties are not a ubiquitous feature of single massive stars but are typical of massive binaries, in which the high-energy emission is generated by the collision of supersonic winds, or by accretion onto a compact companion. However, without direct evidence for companions, the possibility of intrinsic hard X-ray generation from single stars cannot be completely ruled out. The spectral energy distributions of these sources exhibit significant infrared excess, attributable to free-free emission from ionized stellar winds, supplemented by hot dust emission in the case of the WC stars. With the exception of one object located near the outer regions of the Quintuplet cluster, most of the new stars appear isolated or in loose associations. Seven hydrogen-rich WN and O stars are concentrated near the Sagittarius B H II region, while other similar stars and more highly evolved hydrogen-poor WN and WC stars lie scattered within ≈50 pc, in projection, of Sagitarrius A West.

While the X-ray emission of a small fraction of the sources is a simple extrapolation of the synchrotron radiation for the radio-to-optical emission, an inverse Compton (IC) scattering component is necessary to model the X-rays for most of the sources. Considering the sources at rest (the Doppler factor δ = 1), the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) scattering would dominate the IC process.

Considering this effect, the IC/cosmic microwave background (CMB) component would dominate the IC process. We show that the IC/CMB model well explains the X-ray emission for most sources under the equipartition condition. Although the derived beaming factor (δ) and co-moving equipartition magnetic field (B'<SUB>eq</SUB>) of some hot spots are comparable to the knots, the δ values of the hot spots tend to be smaller and their B'<SUB>eq</SUB> values tend to be larger than that of the knots, favoring the idea that the hot spots are jet termination and knots are a part of a well-collimated jet.

Spectra taken through such apertures are used to define LINERs as a class and constrain non-stellar photoionization models for LINERs. Therefore, our energy budget test is a self-consistency check of the idea that the observed emission lines are powered by an AGN. We determine the ionizing luminosities and photon rates by integrating the observed SEDs and by scaling a template SED. We find that even if all ionizing photons are absorbed by the line-emitting gas, more than half of the LINERs in this sample suffer from a deficit of ionizing photons. In 1/3 of LINERs the deficit is severe. If only 10% of the ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas, there is an ionizing photon deficit in 85% of LINERs. We disfavor the possibility that additional electromagnetic power, either obscured or emitted in the unobservable far-UV band, is available from the AGN. Therefore, we consider other power sources such as mechanical heating by compact jets from the AGN and photoionization by either young or old stars. Photoionization by young stars may be important in a small fraction of cases. Mechanical heating can provide enough power in most cases but it is not clear how this power would be transferred to the emission-line gas. Photoionization by post asymptotic giant branch stars is an important power source; it provides more ionizing photons than the AGN in more than half of the LINERs and enough ionizing photons to power the emission lines in 1/3 of the LINERs.

Here, we show that such gas will have a distinct signature when viewed in polarized X-rays. Observations of such polarization can test models for the geometry of the flow and the gas responsible for launching and collimating it.

We investigate the evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gas dynamical calculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays (CRs). Many key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are successfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that CRs were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out from the central AGN.

Deviations of the cluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early cavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas pressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10%-30%.

One of the key proposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer, hotter layers of cool core (CC) clusters to their centers. However, thermal conduction is sensitive to magnetic field topology. In CC clusters where temperature decreases inwards, the heat buoyancy instability (HBI) leads to magnetic fields ordered preferentially in the direction perpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level of conduction below the classical Spitzer-Braginskii value. However, the CC clusters are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Sloshing motions due to minor mergers and stirring motions induced by cluster galaxies or active galactic nuclei can significantly perturb the gas. The turbulent cascade can then affect the topology of the magnetic field and the effective level of thermal conduction. We perform three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermal conduction in CC clusters. We show that very weak subsonic motions, well within observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field and significantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated values expected in the pure unperturbed HBI case. We find that the turbulent motions can essentially restore the conductive heat flow to the CC to level comparable to the theoretical maximum of ~1/3 Spitzer for a highly tangled field. Runs with radiative cooling show that the cooling catastrophe can be averted and the cluster core stabilized; however, this conclusion may depend on the central gas density. Above a critical Froude number, these same turbulent motions also eliminate the tangential bias in the velocity and magnetic field that is otherwise induced by the trapped g-modes, and possibly allow significant turbulent heat diffusion.

Such sloshing may provide a source of heat to the cluster core by mixing hot gas from the cluster outskirts with the cool-core gas. Using high-resolution N-body/Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we model gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by mergers with subclusters. The simulations include merger scenarios with gas-filled and gasless subclusters. The effect of changing the viscosity of the intracluster medium is also explored, but heat conduction is assumed to be negligible. We find that sloshing can facilitate heat inflow to the cluster core, provided that there is a strong enough disturbance. Additionally, sloshing redistributes the gas in the cluster core, causing the gas to expand and decreasing the efficiency of radiative cooling. In adiabatic simulations, we find that sloshing can raise the entropy floor of the cluster core by nearly an order of magnitude in the strongest cases. If the ICM is viscous, the mixing of gases with different entropies is decreased and consequently the heat flux to the core is diminished. In simulations where radiative cooling is included, we find that although eventually a cooling flow develops, sloshing can prevent the significant buildup of cool gas in the core for times on the order of a Gyr for small disturbances and a few Gyr for large ones. If repeated encounters with merging subclusters sustain the sloshing of the central core gas, as is observed, this process can provide a relatively steady source of heat to the core, which can help prevent a significant cooling flow.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","methods: numerical","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

This may represent the result of an evolutionary process in which CVs are produced by dynamical interactions, such as exchange reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to larger orbital radii, over their lifetimes, as they age and become fainter.","keyword":["globular clusters: individual: NGC 6397","novae","cataclysmic variables","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - Galaxy Astrophysics"]}]}}

One of the major goals of this program is to study the evolution of the Sun's X-ray through NUV spectral irradiances with age. Of particular interest is the determination of the young Sun's elevated levels of high-energy fluxes because of the critical roles that X-ray (coronal) through FUV (transition region (TR), chromospheric) emissions play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution (and possible erosion) of early, young planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. Motivated by the current exoplanetary search missions (such as Kepler and CoRoT, along with the planned Space Interferometry Mission and Darwin/Terrestrial Planet Finder missions) that are hunting for Earth-size planets in the habitable zones (liquid water) of nearby main-sequence G-M stars, we are expanding our program to cooler, less luminous, but very importantly, much more numerous main-sequence K-type stars, such as α Centauri B. The long life (2-3× longer than the Sun) and slow evolution of K stars provide nearly constant energy sources for possible hosted planets. This program parallels our \"Sun in Time\" program, but extends the study to stars with deeper convective zone depths. Presented here are X-ray (coronal; ROSAT, Chandra, XMM-Newton), UV (TR; International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)), NUV (chromospheric; IUE), and recently acquired FUV (TR/chromospheric; FUSE Cycles 7/8) observations of the K1 V star α Cen B (HD 128621; V = 1.33; (B - V) = +0.88; τ = 5.6 ± 0.6 Gyr). These combined high-energy measures provide a more complete look into the nature of α Cen B's magnetic activity and X-ray-UV radiances.

The supernova (SN) has evolved into a supernova remnant and its radiative output is dominated by the interaction of the SN blast wave with the pre-existing equatorial ring (ER). The mid-IR spectrum is dominated by emission from ~180 K silicate dust, collisionally heated by the hot X-ray emitting gas with a temperature and density of ~5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> K and ~3 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. The mass of the radiating dust is ~1.2 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> on day 7554 and scales linearly with IR flux. Comparison of the IR data with the soft X-ray flux derived from Chandra observations shows that the IR-to-X-ray flux ratio, IRX, is roughly constant with a value of 2.5. Gas-grain collisions therefore dominate the cooling of the shocked gas. The constancy of IRX is most consistent with the scenario that very little grain processing or gas cooling has occurred throughout this epoch. The shape of the dust spectrum remained unchanged during the observations while the total flux increased by a factor of ~5 with a time dependence of t'<SUP>0.87± 0.20</SUP>, t' being the time since the first encounter between the blast wave and the ER. These observations are consistent with the transitioning of the blast wave from free expansion to a Sedov phase as it propagates into the main body of the ER, as also suggested by X-ray observations. The constant spectral shape of the IR emission provides strong constraints on the density and temperature of the shocked gas in which the interaction takes place. Silicate grains, with radii of ~0.2 μm and temperature of T ~ 180 K, best fit the spectral and temporal evolution of the ~8-30 μm data. The IR spectra also show the presence of a secondary population of very small, hot (T 〉~ 350 K), featureless dust. If these grains spatially coexist with the silicates, then they must have shorter lifetimes. The data show slightly different rates of increase of their respective fluxes, lending some support to this hypothesis. However, the origin of this emission component and the exact nature of its relation to the silicate emission is still a major unsolved puzzle.","keyword":["infrared: general","ISM: individual objects: SN 1987A","ISM: supernova remnants","X-rays: general","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

The current WC sample, although probably not complete, is almost exclusively dominated by late (WCL) types.

We construct a master photometric catalog for the identified X-ray sources including up to 42 bands of UV-to-infrared data, and then calculate their photometric redshifts (photo-z's).

The VGUIDE catalog represents data from only about 9 years of the Chandra mission. Future releases of VGUIDE will include newly identified variable guide stars as the mission proceeds. An important advantage of the use of space data to identify and analyze variable stars is the relatively long observations that are available. The Chandra orbit allows for observations up to 2 days in length. Also, guide stars were often used multiple times for Chandra observations, so many of the stars in the VGUIDE catalog have multiple light curves available from various times in the mission. The catalog is presented as both online data associated with this paper and as a public Web interface. Light curves with data at the instrumental time resolution of about 2 s, overplotted with the data binned at 1 ks, can be viewed on the public Web interface and downloaded for further analysis.

Besides investigating the resulting thermal properties of the ICM, we analyse in detail the effect that these feedback models have on the ICM metal enrichment. We find that AGN feedback has the desired effect of quenching star formation in the brightest cluster galaxies at z 〈 4 and provides correct temperature profiles in the central regions of galaxy groups. However, its effect is not yet sufficient to create `cool cores' in massive clusters while generating an excess of entropy in central regions of galaxy groups. As for the pattern of metal distribution, AGN feedback creates a widespread enrichment in the outskirts of clusters, thanks to its efficiency in displacing enriched gas from galactic haloes to the intergalactic medium. This turns into profiles of iron abundance, Z<SUB>Fe</SUB>, which are in better agreement with observational results, and into a more pristine enrichment of the ICM around and beyond the cluster virial regions.

Six of these SMGs (~17 +/- 6 per cent) have measured X-ray luminosities or upper limits consistent with those expected based on the far-infrared or radio-derived star formation rate, and hence with the X-rays coming solely from star-forming processes.

The evidence therefore suggests that intense star formation accounts for both the far-infrared and X-ray emission in most SMGs.

Then, we solve for the SN velocity dispersion (VD), needed for their own hydrostatic equilibrium, through the equation of state for a partially degenerate neutrino gas. The VD is a unique, continuous function of radius determined by the density and mass of the SN particles. Knowing both the SN density and VD tells us the Tremaine-Gunn phase-space limit at all radii. We find that all 30 systems serendipitously reach the Tremaine-Gunn limit by the centre, which means a portion of the dynamical mass must always be covered by the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly, the typical fitted K-band mass-to-light ratio is unity and at most 1.2, which is very consistent - although leaving no margin for error - with stellar population synthesis models.

These dominant features are common to Seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. In detail, type 1 AGN are clearly distinguished from type 2 by their high spatial resolution SEDs: type 2 AGN exhibit a sharp drop shortwards of 2μm, with the optical to UV region being fully absorbed; type 1s instead show a gentle 2μm drop ensued by a secondary, partially absorbed optical to UV emission bump. On the assumption that the bulk of optical to UV photons generated in these AGN is reprocessed by dust and re-emitted in the IR in an isotropic manner, the IR bump luminosity represents 〉~70 per cent of the total energy output in these objects, and the second energetically important contribution is the high energies above 20keV.Galaxies selected by their warm IR colours, i.e. presenting a relatively flat flux distribution in the 12-60μm range, have often being classified as AGN. The results from these high spatial resolution SEDs question this criterion as a general rule. It is found that the intrinsic shape of the infrared SED of an AGN and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derived from large aperture data.

There is evidence that the X-ray emitting plasma has a subsolar metal abundance. The soft X-ray surface brightness distribution shows a strong correlation with far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission and since the latter serves as a tracer of the inner spiral arms of M33 this is indicative of a close connection between recent star formation activity and the production of soft X-rays. Within 3.5 kpc of the nucleus of M33, the soft X-ray and FUV surface brightness distributions exhibit similar radial profiles.

Changes in the amount of stellar occultation and circumstellar attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur in systems with eccentric orbits. The X-ray emission in eccentric systems can display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state of the shocked plasma at these times.Our simulated X-ray light curves bear many similarities to observed light curves. In systems with circular orbits the light curves show two minima per orbit, which are identical (although not symmetric) if the winds are identical. The maxima in the light curves are produced near quadrature, with a phase delay introduced due to the aberration and curvature of the wind collision region. Circular systems with unequal winds produce minima of different depths and duration. In systems with eccentric orbits the maxima in the light curves may show a very sharp peak (depending on the orientation of the observer), followed by a precipitous drop due to absorption and/or cooling. We show that the rise to maximum does not necessarily follow a 1/d<SUB>sep</SUB> law. Our models further demonstrate that the effective circumstellar column can be highly energy dependent. Therefore, spectral fits which assume energy-independent column(s) are overly simplified and may compromise the interpretation of observed data.To better understand observational analyses of such systems we apply Chandra and Suzaku response files, plus Poisson noise, to the spectra calculated from our simulations and fit these using standard XSPEC models. We find that the recovered temperatures from two- or three-temperature mekal fits are comparable to those from fits to the emission from real systems with similar stellar and orbital parameters/nature. We also find that when the global abundance is thawed in the spectral fits, subsolar values are exclusively returned, despite the calculations using solar values as input. This highlights the problem of fitting oversimplified models to data, and of course is of wider significance than just the work presented here.Further insight into the nature of the stellar winds and the wind-wind collision region in particular systems will require dedicated hydrodynamical modelling, the results of which will follow in due course.","keyword":["shock waves","binaries: general","stars: early-type","stars: mass-loss","winds","outflows","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

This jet emission is tightly and linearly correlated with the X-ray flux; suggesting a common origin.

Ostensibly the compact synchrotron jet could therefore account for ~100per cent of the X-ray flux at low luminosities in the hard state. At the same time, (i) an excess is seen over the exponential decay of the X-ray flux at the point in which the jet would start to dominate, (ii) the X-ray spectrum slightly softens, which seems to be due to a high-energy cut-off or break shifting to a lower energy and (iii) the X-ray rms variability increases.

To explore the effects of BH feedback on groups, we analyse two high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project. While both include galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one of the models includes feedback from accreting BHs. We compare the properties of the simulated galaxy groups to a wide range of observational data, including the entropy and temperature profiles of the intragroup medium, hot gas mass fractions, the luminosity-temperature and mass-temperature scaling relations, the K-band luminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (CBG), SFRs and ages of the CBG, and gas- and stellar-phase metallicities. Both runs yield entropy distributions similar to the data, while the run without active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback yields highly peaked temperature profiles, in discord with the observations. Energy input from supermassive BHs significantly reduces the gas mass fractions of galaxy groups with masses less than a few × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, yielding a gas mass fraction and X-ray luminosity scaling with system temperature that is in excellent agreement with the data, although the detailed scatter in the L-T relation is not quite correct.

By contrast, the run that includes BH feedback yields stellar mass fractions, SFRs and stellar age distributions in excellent agreement with current estimates, thus resolving the long-standing `cooling crisis' of simulations on the scale of groups. Both runs yield very similar gas-phase metal abundance profiles that match X-ray measurements, but they predict very different stellar metallicities.

In spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, the cluster data yield Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.23 +/- 0.04,σ<SUB>8</SUB> = 0.82 +/- 0.05 and w = -1.01 +/- 0.20, incorporating standard priors on the Hubble parameter and mean baryon density of the Universe, and marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. These constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in the form of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, type Ia supernovae, cluster gas mass fractions, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic shear. The combination of our data with current microwave background, supernova, gas mass fraction and baryon acoustic oscillation data yields Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.27 +/- 0.02,σ<SUB>8</SUB> = 0.79 +/- 0.03 and w = -0.96 +/- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. The combined data also allow us to investigate evolving w models. Marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, we constrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectively w<SUB>0</SUB> = -0.88 +/- 0.21 and w<SUB>et</SUB> = -1.05<SUP>+0.20</SUP><SUB>-0.36</SUB>, again including conservative systematic allowances. The combined data provide constraints equivalent to a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 15.5. Our results highlight the power of X-ray studies, which enable the straightforward production of large, complete and pure cluster samples and admit tight scaling relations, to constrain cosmology. However, the new statistical framework we apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at other wavelengths.","keyword":["cosmological parameters","cosmology: observations","large-scale structure of Universe","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

Using the method of Mantz et al.

Such analysis of the survey and follow-up data is crucial, else spurious constraints may be obtained.

In order to interpret these data, we have explored hydrodynamic simulations, followed by computations of simulated spectra and light curves under non-equilibrium ionization conditions, and directly compared them to the observations. Our simulated spectra manage to fit both the X-ray continuum and lines at four epochs satisfactorily, while our computed light curves are in good agreement with additional flux-monitoring data sets. These calculations allow us to infer the nature and structure of the circumstellar medium (CSM), the evolution of the SN shock wave, and the abundances of the ejecta and surrounding medium. The data imply that SN 1996cr exploded in a low-density medium before interacting with a dense shell of material about 0.03 pc away from the progenitor star. We speculate that the shell could be due to the interaction of a blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet wind with a previously existing red supergiant (RSG) wind. The shock wave has now exited the shell and is expanding in the medium exterior to it, possibly the undisturbed continuation of the dense RSG wind. The narrow lines that earned SN 1996cr its IIn designation possibly arise from dense, shocked clumps in the CSM. Although the possibility for a luminous blue variable progenitor for this Type IIn SN cannot be completely excluded, it is inconsistent with much of the data.

Feedback is implemented using a hybrid scheme, where the energy input into intracluster gas by SNe and AGN is taken from a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This ensures that the source of feedback is a population of galaxies that closely resembles that found in the real Universe.

The distribution of X-ray/[O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for masers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a distinct X-ray/[O IV] range, which is, on average, about a factor of four lower than the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the range of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed over the entire X-ray/[O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear obscuration plays a crucial role in determining the probability of maser detection. Furthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker trend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of the 7 μm dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 μm continuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in the AGN unified model, at moderate inclinations away from edge-on, the 7 μm dust absorption may occur without any proportionate X-ray absorption.

Maoz recently challenged this picture based on the observation that the strength of ultraviolet emission relative to the X-ray and radio bands does not depart from empirical trends defined by more luminous sources. He advocates that AGNs across all luminosities have essentially the same accretion and radiative processes, which in luminous sources are described by a standard optically thick, geometrically thin disk. We calculate ADAF models and demonstrate that they can successfully fit the observed spectral energy distributions of the LLAGNs in Maoz's sample. Our model naturally accommodates the radio and X-ray emission, and the ultraviolet flux is well explained by a combination of the first-order Compton scattering in the ADAF, synchrotron emission in the jet, and black body emission in the truncated thin disk. It is premature to dismiss the ADAF model for LLAGNs.

With the results from the numerical simulations, we can not only study the morphology of the SNR but also compute the emission of the remnant in different spectral bands. In particular, we simulate X-ray maps, which can be directly compared to recent and previous observations of Tycho's SNR. Our results suggest that the most likely explanation for Tycho's morphology is that after the supernova (SN) explosion the shock front stripped the envelope of its companion. We represent this effect by adding a conical region with an enhanced density into the initial sphere immediately after the explosion.

We show that once the contribution from the host galaxy is taken into account, the broadband emission from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC 4051 can be well described by the jet model. Contributions from dust and ongoing star formation in the nuclear region tend to dominate the IR emission even at the highest resolutions.

However, for the amazingly regular pattern of these stripes to appear, simultaneous action of a number of shock-plasma phenomena is required, which is not predicted by most models of magnetic field amplification. A consistent explanation of these stripes yields information on the complex nonlinear plasma processes connecting efficient CR acceleration and magnetic field fluctuations in strong collisionless shocks. The nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NL-DSA) model described here, which includes magnetic field amplification from a CR-current-driven instability, does predict stripes consistent with the synchrotron observations of Tycho's SNR.

The number counts are calculated for five different models of the XRB that differ in the assumed hard X-ray luminosity function, the evolution of the Compton thick AGNs, and the underlying AGN spectral model. The majority of the hard X-ray number counts will be Compton thin AGNs, but there is a greater than tenfold increase in the Compton thick number counts from the 6-10 keV to the 10-30 keV band. The Compton thick population shows enough variation that a hard X-ray number counts measurement will constrain the models.

The present investigation aims to study the dependence of resulting light curves on dynamical and physical properties of such a transient disk during its existence. One of the main results derived from our simulations is that blackbody fits of X-ray data tend to overestimate the true mean disk temperature. In fact, the temperature derived from blackbody fits should be identified with the color X-ray temperature rather than the average value derived from the true temperature distribution along the disk. The time interval between the beginning of the circularization of the bound debris and the beginning of the accretion process by the black hole is determined by the viscous (or accretion) timescale, which also fixes the rising part of the resulting light curve. The luminosity peak coincides with the beginning of matter accretion by the black hole and the late evolution of the light curve depends on the evolution of the debris fallback rate. Peak bolometric luminosities are in the range 10<SUP>45</SUP>-10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, whereas peak luminosities in soft X-rays (0.2-2.0 keV) are typically one order of magnitude lower.

The smoothness of these edges has been interpreted as evidence for the stabilizing effect of magnetic fields \"draped\" around the front surfaces. To check this hypothesis, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of magnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters with subclusters. We go beyond previous works on the simulation of cold fronts in a magnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic, idealized mergers with high resolution (Δx ~ 2 kpc). Our simulations sample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths and field configurations. In the simulations, we observe strong velocity shears associated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the cold front surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up to an order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up to near-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. In these layers, the magnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts against Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seen in observations of real clusters. These magnetic fields also result in strong suppression of mixing of high- and low-entropy gases in the cluster, seen in our simulations of mergers in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, the heating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to stave off a cooling catastrophe.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","methods: numerical","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The dynamics is based on solutions of relativistic magnetic reconnection with a guide field from Lyubarsky. Electron distributions in each region are chosen to match the pressure and density of the local plasma. Synchrotron emission from both regions is used to calculate Compton scattering, Compton drag and photon-photon opacity effects, with exact treatment of anisotropy and the Klein-Nishina regime.

This source is known to be one of the 'outliers' of the universal radio/X-ray correlation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displaying fainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity than expected from the correlation. Our study shows that the radio and X-ray emission of H1743-322 are strongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state.

We investigate this intriguing issue through a 2D hydrodynamic model that takes into account, for the first time, the mixing of ejecta with the inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium, the thermal conduction, the radiative losses from optically thin plasma and the deviations from equilibrium of ionization induced by plasma dynamics. The model was set up on the basis of the observational results. We found that the thermal conduction plays an important role in the evolution of W49B, inducing the evaporation of the circumstellar ring-like cloud (whose presence has been deduced from previous observations) that mingles with the surrounding hot medium, cooling down the shocked plasma, and pushes the ejecta backwards to the centre of the remnant, forming there a jet-like structure. During the evolution, a large region of overionized plasma forms within the remnant. The overionized plasma originates from the rapid cooling of the hot plasma originally heated by the shock reflected from the dense ring-like cloud. In particular, we found two different ways for the rapid cooling of plasma to appear: (i) the mixing of relatively cold and dense material evaporated from the ring with the hot shocked plasma and (ii) the rapid adiabatic expansion of the ejecta.

At this stage, the tunnel, produced by the enduring outflow (hard to detect in the mock X-ray surface brightness maps), is easily fragmented, producing tiny buoyant bubbles, typically a few kpc in size. In contrast to galaxy clusters, the AGN self-regulated feedback has to be persistent, with a ‘delicate touch’, rather than rare and explosive strokes. This evolutionary difference dictates that galaxy groups are not scaled-down versions of clusters: AGN heating might operate in different regimes, contributing to the self-similarity breaking observed.","keyword":["hydrodynamics","galaxies: active","galaxies: groups: general","intergalactic medium","galaxies: jets","x-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

This is because we show that, while the luminosities of the bright central galaxies (BCGs) in these systems are consistent with their high dynamical masses, their richnesses (total number of galaxies above some canonical value) are extremely low. This leads us to suggest a new interpretation of fossil systems in which the large differences between the luminosities of their brightest and second brightest galaxies are simply the result of the high BCG luminosities and low richnesses, while the high masses and low richnesses also explain the high mass-to-light ratios. Our results therefore suggest that fossil systems can be characterized as cluster-like in their masses and BCG luminosities, but possessing the richnesses and optical luminosities of relatively poor groups.

In many earlier studies, spherical symmetry has been assumed partly because of limited data quality; however, new deep observations and instrumental designs will make it possible to go beyond that assumption. Measuring the temperature and density profiles are of interest when observing the X-ray gas; however, the spatial shape of the gas itself also carries very useful information. For example, it is believed that the X-ray gas shape in the inner parts of galaxy clusters is greatly affected by feedback mechanisms, cooling, and rotation, and measuring this shape can therefore indirectly provide information on these mechanisms. In this paper, we present a novel method to measure the three-dimensional shape of the intracluster X-ray-emitting gas. We can measure the shape from X-ray observations only, i.e., the method does not require combination with independent measurements of, e.g., the cluster mass or density profile. This is possible when one uses the full spectral information contained in the observed spectra. We demonstrate the method by measuring radially dependent shapes along the line of sight for CHANDRA mock data. We find that at least 10<SUP>6</SUP> photons are required to get a 5σ detection of shape for an X-ray gas having realistic features such as a cool core and a double power law for the density profile. We illustrate how Bayes' theorem is used to find the best-fitting model of the X-ray gas, an analysis that is very important in a real observational scenario where the true spatial shape is unknown. Not including a shape in the fit may propagate to a mass bias if the X-ray is used to estimate the total cluster mass. We discuss this mass bias for a class of spatial shapes.","keyword":["X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

This contrast has further sharpened in light of recent observations uncovering a preponderance of HMXBs hosting loosely bound Be donors orbiting neutron stars (NSs), which would be expected to naturally evolve into He-HMXBs through dynamical mass transfer onto the NS and a common-envelope (CE) phase. Hence, reconciling the large population of Be-HMXBs with the observation of only one He-HMXB can help constrain the dynamics of CE physics. Here, we use detailed stellar structure and evolution models and show that binary mergers of HMXBs during CE events must be common in order to resolve the tension between these observed populations. We find that, quantitatively, this scenario remains consistent with the typically adopted energy parameterization of CE evolution, yielding expected populations which are not at odds with current observations. However, future observations which better constrain the underlying population of loosely bound O/B-NS binaries are likely to place significant constraints on the efficiency of CE ejection.","keyword":["galaxies: starburst","stars: emission-line","Be","stars: Wolf-Rayet","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

In this context, detection of AGN pairs should be relatively common. Observationally, however, dual AGNs are scant, being just a few percent of all AGNs. In this Letter, we investigate the triggering of AGN activity in merging galaxies via a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We follow the dynamics and accretion onto the SMBHs as they move from separations of tens of kiloparsecs to tens of parsecs. Our resolution, cooling, and star formation implementation produce an inhomogeneous, multi-phase interstellar medium, allowing us to accurately trace star formation and accretion onto the SMBHs. We study the impact of gas content, morphology, and mass ratio, focusing on AGN activity and dynamics across a wide range of relevant conditions. We test when the two AGNs are simultaneously detectable, for how long and at which separations. We find that strong dual AGN activity occurs during the late phases of the mergers, at small separations (〈1-10 kpc) below the resolution limit of most surveys. Much of the SMBH accretion is not simultaneous, limiting the dual AGN fraction detectable through imaging and spectroscopy to a few percent, in agreement with observational samples.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: interactions","galaxies: nuclei","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Most of these outliers tend to cluster below the best-fitting line, possibly indicative of two distinct tracks which might reflect different accretion regimes within the hard state. Here, we employ and compare state of the art data clustering techniques in order to identify and characterize different data groupings within the radio/X-ray luminosity plane for 18 hard and quiescent state black hole X-ray binaries with nearly simultaneous multiwavelength coverage.

Additionally, there is evidence for at least two sources (H1743-322 and GRO J1655-500) jumping from the lower to the upper track as they fade towards quiescence, further indicating that black hole spin does not play any major role in defining the radio loudness of compact jets from hard black hole X-ray binaries.

Besides introducing a further level of complexity in understanding the interplay between synchrotron and Comptonized emission from black hole X-ray binaries, the existence of two tracks in the radio/X-ray domain underscores that a high level of caution must be exercised when employing black hole luminosity-luminosity relations for the purpose of estimating a third parameter, such as distance or mass.","keyword":["accretion","accretion discs","black hole physics","methods: statistical","ISM: jets and outflows","radio continuum: general","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae are usually assumed to be either a single white dwarf accreting from a non-degenerate companion (the single-degenerate channel) or the result of two merging white dwarfs (the double degenerate channel). However, no consensus currently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether the observed Type Ia supernovae rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a double degenerate progenitor, a single-degenerate progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a prolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter on the surface of the white dwarf. An argument against the single-degenerate channel as a significant producer of Type Ia supernovae has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical galaxies. <BR /> Aims: We wish to determine whether it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray emission from a nuclear-burning white dwarf in an accreting single-degenerate binary system.

These studies have been carried out under the assumption that the ICM is a homogeneous medium. This, however, might not be a good approximation if heavy elements are able to sediment in the inner region of the galaxy cluster. Motivated by the need to obtain a more complete picture of the dynamical properties of the ICM, we analyze the stability of a weakly collisional, magnetized plane-parallel atmosphere which is stratified in both temperature and composition. This allows us to discuss for the first time the dynamics of weakly collisional environments where heat conduction, momentum transport, and ion-diffusion are anisotropic with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. We show that depending on the relative signs and magnitudes of the gradients in the temperature and the mean molecular weight, the plasma can be subject to a wide variety of unstable modes which include modifications to the magnetothermal instability (MTI), the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), and overstable gravity modes previously studied in homogeneous media. We also find that there are new modes which are driven by heat conduction and particle diffusion. We discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings for a representative galaxy cluster where helium has sedimented. Our findings suggest that the core insulation that results from the magnetic field configurations that arise as a natural consequence of the HBI, which would be MTI stable in a homogeneous medium, could be alleviated if the mean molecular weight gradient is steep enough, i.e., (∇μ)/μ 〉 (∇T)/T. This study constitutes a first step toward understanding the interaction between magnetic turbulence and the diffusion of heavy elements, and its consequences for the long-term evolution and observational signatures of the ICM in galaxy clusters.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","instabilities","magnetohydrodynamics: MHD","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that absorption by He in the GRB's host H II region is responsible for most of the absorption. We show that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_H_X) is correlated with both the neutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow's dust extinction (A<SUB>V</SUB> ). This correlation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high N_H_X values. From these correlations, we exclude an origin of the X-ray absorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e., the intergalactic medium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the correlation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the correlation with the neutral gas does not. From this, we conclude that the column density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column density in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of the fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong redshift evolution of N_H_X/A_V is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies and we find it to be consistent with measurements of the redshift evolution of metallicities for GRB host galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays in GRB afterglows is caused by He in the H II region hosting the GRB. While dust is destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to great distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionizing UV continuum much closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionized state.

The ring spectra are then combined into a BL spectrum taking Doppler broadening and limb darkening into account. <BR /> Results: Two sets of model BL spectra are computed, the first of them consists of BL models with fixed WD mass (1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) and various relative WD angular velocities (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 break-up velocities), while the other deals with a fixed relative angular velocity (0.8 break-up velocity) and various WD masses (0.8, 1, and 1.2 M<SUB>☉</SUB>). The model spectra show broad absorption features because of blending of numerous absorption lines, and emission-like features at spectral regions with only a few strong absorption lines. The model spectra are very similar to observed soft X-ray/EUV spectra of SS Cyg and U Gem in outburst.

However, there is a wide distribution of both, the halo emission measure and the O vii column density, suggesting that the Galactic warm-hot gaseous halo is anisotropic. We present Suzaku observations of fields close to two sightlines along which we have precise O vii absorption measurements with Chandra. The column densities along these two sightlines are similar within errors, but we find that the emission measures are different: 0.0025±0.0006 cm<SUP>-6</SUP> pc near the Mrk 421 direction and 0.0042±0.0008 cm<SUP>-6</SUP> pc close to the PKS 2155-304 sightline.

In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of BHs and NSs based on the power-law IMF variation required to reproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then test whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, an NS or BH accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their number is therefore expected to scale with the number of BHs and NSs present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band light is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore demonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to those now dominating the K-band light and are consistent with an invariant IMF.

To overcome the problem of uncertain individual ages and large spreads of age distributions for entire clusters, we compute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples within annular subregions of the clusters.

These findings are further supported by the spatial gradients in the disk fraction and K-band excess frequency. Our age analysis is based on Age<SUB>JX</SUB> estimates for PMS stars and is independent of any consideration of OB stars. The result has important implications for the formation of young stellar clusters. One basic implication is that clusters form slowly and the apparent age spreads in young stellar clusters, which are often controversial, are (at least in part) real. The result further implies that simple models where clusters form inside-out are incorrect and more complex models are needed.

We describe a multivariate scaling model that enables a fully self-consistent treatment of multiple observational catalogues in the presence of property covariance and apply this formalism when interpreting published results. The corrections due to scatter and observable covariance can be significant. For instance, our predicted Y<SUB>SZ</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> scaling relation differs from that derived using the naive `plug in' method by ≈25 per cent. Finally, we test the mass normalization for each of the X-ray data sets we consider by applying a space density consistency test: we compare the observed ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-ray (REFLEX) luminosity function to expectations from published L<SUB>X</SUB>-M relations convolved with the mass function for a Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 flat Λ cold dark matter model.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

Besides a set of non-radiative simulations, we carried out two sets of simulations including radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment and feedback from supernovae (SNe), one of which also accounts for the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) resulting from gas accretion on to supermassive black holes. These simulations are analysed with the aim of studying the relative role played by SN and AGN feedback on the general properties of the diffuse hot baryons in galaxy clusters and groups: scaling relations, temperature, entropy and pressure radial profiles, and ICM chemical enrichment. We find that simulations including AGN feedback produce scaling relations between X-ray observable quantities that are in good agreement with observations at all mass scales. Observed pressure profiles are also shown to be quite well reproduced in our radiative simulations, especially when AGN feedback is included. However, our simulations are not able to account for the observed diversity between cool-core and non-cool-core clusters, as revealed by X-ray observations: unlike for observations, we find that temperature and entropy profiles of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are quite similar and resemble more the observed behaviour of non-cool-core clusters. As for the pattern of metal enrichment, we find that an enhanced level of iron abundance is produced by AGN feedback with respect to the case of purely SN feedback. As a result, while simulations including AGN produce values of iron abundance in groups in agreement with observations, they over-enrich the ICM in massive clusters. The efficiency of AGN feedback in displacing enriched gas from haloes into the intergalactic medium at high redshift also creates a widespread enrichment in the outskirts of clusters and produces profiles of iron abundance whose slope is in better agreement with observations. By analysing the pattern of the relative abundances of silicon and iron and the fraction of metals in the stellar phase, our results clearly show that different sources of energy feedback leave different imprints in the enrichment pattern of the hot ICM and stars. Our results confirm that including AGN feedback goes in the right direction of reconciling simulation predictions and observations for several observational ICM properties. Still a number of important discrepancies highlight that the model still needs to be improved to produce the correct interplay between cooling and feedback in central cluster regions.","keyword":["methods: numerical","galaxies: clusters: general","cosmology: miscellaneous","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

Using the results of a large Suzaku study, we find that Seyfert 2s have on average lower Fe Kα luminosities than Seyfert 1s for the same 10-50 keV continuum luminosity. Simulating dummy Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s populations using physical torus models of X-ray reflected emission, we find that this difference can be explained by means of different average inclination angles with respect to the torus, as predicted by the unified model. Alternative explanations include differences in the intensities of Compton humps, in the photon index distributions or in the average iron abundances. We show that the ratio between the flux of the broad and narrow Fe Kα line in the 6.35-6.45 keV range depends on the torus geometry considered, and is on average 〈25 per cent and 〈15 per cent for type-I and type-II AGN, respectively. We find evidence of absorption of the narrow Fe Kα line flux in Compton-thick AGN, which suggests that part of the reflecting material is obscured. We estimate that on average in obscured AGN the reflected radiation from neutral material is seen through a column density which is 1/4 of that absorbing the primary X-ray emission. This should be taken into account in synthesis models of the CXB and when studying the luminosity function of heavily obscured AGN.

Here, we investigate this problem via an accounting exercise: we use empirically determined properties of four well-studied massive star clusters to determine where the energy injected by stellar winds ultimately ends up.

Due to the strong dependence of the mean free path on the photon energy, the X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) can have a significant impact on the interferometric signal from the cosmic dawn. Recent Chandra observations of nearby, star-forming galaxies show that their SEDs are more complicated than is usually assumed in 21 cm studies.

The comparison with the sample of X-ray flares detected during the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign favors the hypothesis that the 2011 March 30 flare is a single flare rather than two distinct subflares. We model the light curve of this flare with the gravitational lensing of a simple hotspot-like structure, but we cannot satisfactorily reproduce the large decay of the light curve between the two subflares with this model. From magnetic energy heating during the rise phase of the first subflare and assuming an X-ray photons production efficiency of 1 and a magnetic field of 100 G at 2 r<SUB>g</SUB>, we derive an upper limit to the radial distance of the first subflare of 100<SUP>+19</SUP><SUB>-29</SUB> r<SUB>g</SUB>.

At z ~ 1, AGNs show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive (non-AGN) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxy disturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpy structure). In contrast, at z ~ 2, AGNs show similar levels of galaxy disturbance as inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which may arise from a more pronounced bulge in AGN hosts or extinguished nuclear light. We undertake a number of tests of both these alternatives, but our results do not strongly favor one interpretation over the other. The mean SFR and its distribution among AGNs and inactive galaxies are similar at z〉 1.5.

We found that Pismis 24 is a very young (~1-3 Myr) open cluster with a Salpeter-like initial mass function and a few thousand members. A comparison between optical and infrared photometry indicates that the fraction of members with a near-infrared excess (i.e., with a circumstellar disk) is in the range 0.3-0.6, consistent with its photometrically derived age. We also find that Pismis 24 is likely subdivided into a few different subclusters, one of which contains almost all the massive members. There are indications of current star formation triggered by these massive stars, but clear age trends could not be derived (although the fraction of stars with a near-infrared excess does increase towards the Hii region associated with the cluster). The gas out of which Pismis 24 formed must have been distributed in dense clumps within a cloud of less dense gas ~1 pc in radius. <BR /> Conclusions: Our findings provide some new insight into how young stellar populations and massive stars emerge, and evolve in the first few Myr after birth, from a giant molecular cloud complex.Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 63.L-0717.Tables 1 and 2 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/573/A95\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/573/A95</A>Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424388/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>","keyword":["stars: formation","stars: massive","open clusters and associations: individual: Pismis 24","HII regions","ISM: individual objects: NGC 6357","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are proposed as one new sub-class of SNe Ia since they present sufficiently distinct observational properties from the bulk of SNe Ia. Observationally, SNe Iax have been estimated to account for ~5%-30% of the total SN Ia rate, and most SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. In addition, observations constrain the progenitor systems of some SN Iax progenitors that have ages of 〈80 Myr. Although the identity of the progenitors of SNe Iax is unclear, the weak deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass (Ch-mass) carbon/oxygen white dwarfs (C/O WDs) seem to provide a viable physical scenario. <BR /> Aims: Comparing theoretical predictions from binary population synthesis (BPS) calculations with observations of SNe Iax, we put constraints on the single-degenerate (SD) Ch-mass model as a possible SN Iax progenitor. <BR /> Methods: Based on the SD Ch-mass model, the SN rates and delay times are predicted by combining binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a BPS model. Moreover, with current X-ray observations of SNe Iax, we constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rates of stellar progenitor systems by using two analytic models. <BR /> Results: From our calculations, the long delay times of ≳3 Gyr and low SN rates of ~3 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> are found in the red-gaint donor channel, indicating that this channel is unlikely to produce SNe Iax. With our standard models, we predict that the Galactic SN Iax rate from the main-sequence (helium-star) donor scenario is ~1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (~3 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). The total rate of these two models is consistent with the observed SN Iax rate. The short delay times in the helium-star donor channel (〈100 Myr) support the young host environments of SNe Iax. However, the relatively long delay times in the main-sequence donor channel (~250 Myr-1 Gyr) are less favourable for the observational constraints on the ages of SN Iax progenitors.

However, at least one SN Iax event (SN 2008ge) is hosted by an S0 galaxy with no signs of star formation. Current X-ray observations for SNe Iax cannot rule out the SD Ch-mass model. Taking all these into account and considering the uncertainty of the observed rate for SN Iax events, we suggest that some SNe Iax may be produced from weak deflagrations of Ch-mass C/O WDs in SD progenitor systems, especially in the helium-star donor channel. This is consistent with recent analysis of HST observations, which suggests that the SN Iax SN2012Z had a progenitor system which contained a helium-star companion. However, this SD deflagration model is still unlikely to be the most common progenitor scenario for SNe Iax.","keyword":["supernovae: general","binaries: close","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Overall, our approach is able to retrieve on average 15% of all AGNs in the field identified by means of spectroscopic or X-ray classification, with a strong dependence on the source apparent magnitude (completeness ranging from 26% to 5%). In particular, the completeness for Type 1 AGNs is 25%, while it drops to 6% for Type 2 AGNs. The rest of the X-ray selected AGN population presents on average a larger rms variability than the bulk of non-variable sources, indicating that variability detection for at least some of these objects is prevented only by the photometric accuracy of the data. The low completeness is in part due to the short observing span: we show that increasing the temporal baseline results in larger samples as expected for sources with a red-noise power spectrum.

Using multiple filters of IRC instrument, we selected more than 4000 galaxies from their rest-frame emission at 8 μm, from z ≃ 0.2 to ~2. We built spectral energy distributions from the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) to the far-IR by adding ancillary data in the optical-near IR and from GALEX and Herschel surveys. We fit spectral energy distributions with the physically-motivated code CIGALE. We test different templates for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and recipes for dust attenuation and estimate stellar masses, star formation rates, amount of dust attenuation, and AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. We discuss the uncertainties affecting these estimates on a subsample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We also define a subsample of galaxies with an IR luminosity close to the characteristic IR luminosity at each redshift and study the evolution of dust attenuation of this selection representative of the bulk of the IR emission. <BR /> Results: The AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity is found to be on average approximately 10%, with a slight increase with redshift. The determination of AGN contribution does not depend significantly on the assumed AGN templates except for galaxies detected in X-ray. The choice of attenuation law has a marginal impact on the determination of stellar masses and star formation rates. Dust attenuation in galaxies dominating the IR luminosity function is found to increase from z = 0 to z = 1 and to remain almost constant from z = 1 to z = 1.5. Conversely, when galaxies are selected at a fixed IR luminosity, their dust attenuation slightly decreases as redshift increases but with a large dispersion, confirming previous results obtained at lower redshift.The attenuation in our mid-IR selected sample is found ~2 mag higher than that found globally in the universe or in UV and Hα line selections in the same redshift range. This difference is well explained by an increase of dust attenuation with the stellar mass, in global agreement with other recent studies. Starbursting galaxies do not systematically exhibit a high attenuation. We conclude that the galaxies selected in IR and dominating the star formation exhibit a higher attenuation than those measured on average in the universe because they are massive systems. Conversely UV selected galaxies exhibit a large range of stellar masses leading in a lower average attenuation than that found in an IR selection.","keyword":["galaxies: photometry","surveys","infrared: galaxies","ultraviolet: galaxies","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: ISM","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

For instance, one big bump is located on the northeastern (NE) limb and several relatively small ones on the southwestern (SW) limb on the detected morphologies from the observations in the radio and X-rays. <BR /> Aims: The generation of the asymmetric morphology of non-thermal X-rays for SN 1006 is investigated through three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the density distribution of the ambient material can be investigated by comparing the resulting synchrotron morphology with the detected images of the hard X-ray emission. <BR /> Methods: First, the remnant was simulated as a supernova explosion evolved in a turbulent plasma with a relatively small amplitude for the turbulence. In the model, several spherical cavities with lower densities compared with the background plasma were employed to reproduce the detected bumps at the bright limbs. Second, the effect of the modification on the morphology of the remnant due to efficient cosmic ray acceleration was investigated by adopting a lower adiabatic index. <BR /> Results: If we assume that the injection efficiency of electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process at the shock follows the quasi-parallel scenario, the hard X-ray morphology of SN 1006 with bumps in the bright NE and SW regions can be generally reproduced by employing cavities in the background medium in the non-modification scenario.

Chaotic cold accretion (CCA) profoundly differs from classic accretion models, as Bondi and thin disc theories. Using 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, we now probe the impact of rotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the hot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a geometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the black hole accretion rate to ~1/3 of the spherical case value. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure support and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk; the accretion rate is decoupled from the cooling rate, although it is higher than that of the hot mode. In the more common state of a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas velocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor number Ta<SUB>t</SUB>〈 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via thermal instability (TI) and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi rate (Ṁ<SUB>∙</SUB> ~ Ṁ<SUB>cool</SUB>). Initially, turbulence broadens the angular momentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with prograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold filaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of angular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. As turbulence weakens (Ta<SUB>t</SUB> 〉 1), the broadening of the distribution and the efficiency of collisions diminish, damping the accretion rate ∝ Ta<SUB>t</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP>, until the cold disk drives the dynamics.

The synthetic Hα images reproduce the main features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals, as the line fluxes and the filaments versus disk morphology. Such dichotomy is key for the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops and boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk remains the sole cold structure. Its consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot mode with suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle.","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","black hole physics","hydrodynamics","galaxies: ISM","instabilities","turbulence","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics - Fluid Dynamics"]}]}}

Magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure in both gas components at all selected positions, assuming random orientation of the magnetic field.

These findings agree with previous analyses on other cool-core, relaxed clusters, and lend further support to the picture by Lapi et al. that relates the entropy flattening, the development of the nonthermal pressure component, and the azimuthal variation of ICM properties to weakening boundary shocks. In this scenario clusters are born in a high-entropy state throughout, and are expected to develop on similar timescales a low-entropy state both at the center due to cooling, and in the outskirts due to weakening shocks.

The most popular explanation for the anomalously high and hard X-ray fluxes is that these jets do not decelerate significantly by the kiloparsec scale, but rather remain highly relativistic (Lorentz factors {Γ }∼ 10). By adopting a small angle to the line of sight, the X-rays can thus be explained by inverse Compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons (IC/CMB), where the observed emission is strongly Doppler boosted. Using over six years of Fermi monitoring data, we show that the expected hard, steady gamma-ray emission implied by the IC/CMB model is not seen in PKS 0637-752, the prototype jet for which this model was first proposed. IC/CMB emission is thus ruled out as the source of the X-rays, joining recent results for the jets in 3C 273 (using the same method) and PKS 1136-135 (using UV polarization). We further show that the Fermi observations give an upper limit of δ \\lt 6.5 for the four brightest X-ray knots of PKS 0637-752, and derive an updated limit of δ \\lt 7.8 for knots A and B1 of 3C 273 (assuming equipartition).

The observed IRX ratios are compared with theoretical predictions that yield IRX ratios an order of magnitude larger. This discrepancy may originate from the dearth of dust in the remnants due to either the local variation of the dust abundance in the preshock medium with respect to the canonical abundance or the dust destruction in the postshock medium.

As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on details in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for baryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic correction model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only N-body simulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted feedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot gas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3- central galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all modify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles allow to define a displacement field for particles in N-body simulations and to modify the total density field accordingly.The main advantage of the baryonic correction model is to connect the total matter density field to the observable distribution of gas and stars in haloes, making it possible to parametrise baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. We show that the most crucial quantities are the mass fraction of ejected gas and its corresponding ejection radius. The former controls how strongly baryons suppress the power spectrum, while the latter provides a measure of the scale where baryonic effects become important. A comparison with X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster observations suggests that baryons suppress wave modes above k~0.5 h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 10-25 percent around k~ 2 h/Mpc.

In practice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, no matter how they are identified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation function whose general shape and normalization are poorly known.

The AGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all galaxies but with a lower normalization - the fraction of haloes with AGN in our sample is a few per cent. The number of AGN satellite galaxies scales as a power law with host halo mass with a power-law index α = 1. By highlighting the relatively `normal' way in which moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy haloes, our results suggest that the environmental signature of distinct fuelling modes for luminous quasars compared to moderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed.","keyword":["galaxies: abundances","galaxies: active","galaxies: haloes","galaxies: Seyfert","galaxies: stellar content","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

We found that in this luminosity range the photon index (obtained from fitting a simple absorbed power law in the 0.5-10 keV range) increases with decreasing 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity (i.e. the spectrum softens). Such behaviour has been reported before for individual sources, but here we demonstrate that very likely most (if not all) neutron star systems behave in a similar manner and possibly even follow a universal relation.

First we demonstrate the feasibility of this method using both the analytical NFW model and simulated halos in a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We then apply, as a proof of concept, this method to the Subaru weak lensing data and the XMM/Chandra X-ray observables for a sample of 50 massive clusters in the redshift range 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.3, where their halo masses differ from each other by up to a factor of 10. To estimate the NFW parameters of each cluster, we use the halo mass proxy relation of X-ray observables, based on either the hydrostatic equilibrium or the gas mass, and then infer the halo concentration from the model scaling relation of halo concentration with halo mass. We evaluate the performance of the NFW scaling analysis by measuring the scatters of 50 cluster lensing profiles relative to the NFW predictions over a range of radii, 0.14 ≤ R/[h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc] ≤ 2.8. We found 4-6 σ-level evidence of the universal NFW profile in 50 clusters, for both the X-ray halo mass proxy relations, although the gas mass appears to be a better proxy of the underlying true mass.

Depending on whether a T Tauri star accretes material from its circumstellar disk or not, different X-ray emission properties can be found.

A considerable number of classified non-accreting sources show accretion rates comparable to those of classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS). Our data do not allow us to confirm the classification between classical and weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS), and the number of WTTS in this work is small compared to the complete samples.

The spread in the data suggests dependencies of the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities other than the stellar mass, but the similarity between Orion and Taurus hints at the environment not being one of them.

We also discuss the possibility that the ionized wind or outflow has been launched by radiation force produced by the central star cluster. Finally, we remark on the detailed structure of a prominent radio emission feature located within the shell of the Sgr A east supernova remnant. Because this feature—the “Sigma Front”—correlates well in shape and orientation with the nearby edge of the CND, we propose that it is a reflected shock wave resulting from the impact of the Sgr A east blast wave on the CND.","keyword":["Galaxy: center","H ii regions","ISM: individual objects: Sagittarius A","ISM: jets and outflows","ISM: supernova remnants","radio continuum: ISM","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

The targets have X-ray luminosities representative of the parent AGN population and we explore the emission-line luminosities as a function of X-ray luminosity. For the [O III] targets, ≈50 per cent have ionized gas velocities indicative of gas that is dominated by outflows and/or highly turbulent material (i.e. overall line widths ≳600 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The most luminous half (i.e. L<SUB>X</SUB> 〉 6 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) have a ≳2 times higher incidence of such velocities. On the basis of our results, we find no evidence that X-ray obscured AGN are more likely to host extreme kinematics than unobscured AGN. Our KASHz sample has a distribution of gas velocities that is consistent with a luminosity-matched sample of z 〈 0.4 AGN. This implies little evolution in the prevalence of ionized outflows, for a fixed AGN luminosity, despite an order-of-magnitude decrease in average star formation rates over this redshift range. Furthermore, we compare our Hα targets to a redshift-matched sample of star-forming galaxies and despite a similar distribution of Hα luminosities and likely star formation rates, we find extreme ionized gas velocities are up to ≈10 times more prevalent in the AGN-host galaxies. Our results reveal a high prevalence of extreme ionized gas velocities in high-luminosity X-ray AGN and imply that the most powerful ionized outflows in high-redshift galaxies are driven by AGN activity.","keyword":["galaxies: active - galaxies: evolution","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","quasars: emission lines"]}]}}

Most of these results are based on the analysis of broad-band photometric data. Here, we study the optical spectra of a sample of 19 BCGs hosted by X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at 0.15 〈z 〈 0.3, a subset from the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project sample. We identify plausible star formation histories of the galaxies by fitting simple stellar populations as well as composite populations, consisting of a young stellar component superimposed on an intermediate/old stellar component, to accurately constrain their star formation histories. We detect prominent young (̃200 Myr) stellar populations in four of the 19 galaxies. Of the four, the BCG in Abell 1835 shows remarkable A-type stellar features indicating a relatively large population of young stars, which is extremely unusual even amongst star-forming BCGs. We constrain the mass contribution of these young components to the total stellar mass to be typically between 1 and 3 per cent, but rising to 7 per cent in Abell 1835. We find that the four of the BCGs with strong evidence for recent star formation (and only these four galaxies) are found within a projected distance of 5 kpc of their host cluster's X-ray peak, and the diffuse, X-ray gas surrounding the BCGs exhibits a ratio of the radiative cooling-to-free-fall time (t<SUB>c</SUB>/t<SUB>ff</SUB>) of ≤10. These are also some of the clusters with the lowest central entropy. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the precipitation-driven star formation and active galactic nucleus feedback model, in which the radiatively cooling diffuse gas is subject to local thermal instabilities once the instability parameter t<SUB>c</SUB>/t<SUB>ff</SUB> falls below ̃10, leading to the condensation and precipitation of cold gas. The number of galaxies in our sample where the host cluster satisfies all the criteria for recent and ongoing star formation is small, but their stellar populations suggest a time-scale for star formation to restart of the order of ̃200 Myr.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular","cD","galaxies: stellar content","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

As a result, core-collapse supernovae in these regions should also be expected. In this paper, we consider the observational consequences of predicting the fate of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sphere of influence of quiescent SMBHs. We present these results in the context of `autarkic' nuclei, a model that describes quiescent nuclei as steady-state and self-sufficient environments where the SMBH accretes stellar winds with no appreciable inflow of material from beyond the sphere of influence. These regions have properties such as gas density that scale with the mass of the SMBH. Using predictions of the X-ray lifetimes of SNRs originating in the sphere of influence, we make estimates of the number of core collapse SNRs present at a given time. With the knowledge of lifetimes of SNRs and their association with young stars, we predict a number of core-collapse SNRs that grows from ̃1 around Milky Way-like (4.3 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>) SMBHs to ̃100 around the highest mass (10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>) SMBHs. The presence of young SNRs will amplify the X-ray emission near quiescent SMBHs, and we show that the total core-collapse SNR emission has the potential to influence soft X-ray searches for very low-luminosity SMBHs. Our SNR lifetime estimates also allow us to predict star formation rates in these regions.

All of our data are obtained from the archive X-ray point-source catalogues from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, and the far-infrared 70 μm point-source catalogue from Spitzer-MIPS observations. Although the IRAC [3.6 μm]-[4.5 μm] versus [5.8 μm]-[8.0 μm] colours of our sample indicate that only ̃63 per cent of our sources would be classified as AGNs, the ratio of the rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity to the total infrared luminosity (8-1000 μm) shows that the entire sample has comparatively higher X-ray luminosity than that expected from pure star-forming galaxies, suggesting the presence of an AGN in all of our sources. From an analysis of the X-ray hardness ratio, we find that sources with both 70 μm and X-ray detection tend to have a higher hardness ratio relative to the whole X-ray-selected source population, suggesting the presence of more X-ray absorption in the 70 μm detected sources. In addition, we find that the observed far-infrared colours of 70 μm detected sources with and without X-ray emission are similar, suggesting the far-infrared emission could be mainly powered by star formation.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: high-redshift","infrared: galaxies","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

For each cluster, the observed tangential shear profile is described well by either a single Navarro-Frenk-White model or a two-component model including the BCG as an unresolved point mass. For A478, we determine the BCG and its host-halo masses from a joint fit to weak-lensing and stellar photometry measurements. We find that the choice of initial mass functions (IMFs) can introduce a factor of 2 uncertainty in the BCG mass, whereas the BCG host-halo mass is constrained well by data. We perform a joint analysis of the weak-lensing and stellar kinematics data available for the Hydra A cluster, which allows us to constrain the central mass profile without assuming specific IMFs. We find that the central mass profile (r 〈 300 kpc) determined from the joint analysis is in excellent agreement with those from independent measurements, including dynamical masses estimated from the cold gas disc component, X-ray hydrostatic total mass estimates, and the central stellar mass estimated with the Salpeter IMF.

We propose here that a fast outflow made of a pulsar-stellar wind mixture is always present moving away from the binary in the apastron direction, with the injection of stellar wind occurring at orbital phases close to periastron passage. This outflow periodically loaded with stellar wind would move with a high speed, and likely host non-thermal activity due to shocks, on scales similar to those of the observed moving X-ray object. Such an outflow is thus a very good candidate to explain this X-ray feature.

We first measure the star-forming galactic disc sizes, as well as the SFRs of these galaxies, using data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, and then show that (1) the specific 0.5-2 keV luminosity of the coronal emission correlates with the specific SFR in a sub-linear fashion: on average, L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>K</SUB>∝(SFR/M<SUB>*</SUB>)<SUP>Γ</SUP> with Γ = 0.29 ± 0.12; (2) the efficiency of the emission L<SUB>X</SUB>/SFR decreases with increasing surface SFR (I<SUB>SFR</SUB>; Γ = -0.44 ± 0.12); and (3) the characteristic temperature of the X-ray-emitting plasma weakly correlates with I<SUB>SFR</SUB> (Γ = 0.08 ± 0.04).
