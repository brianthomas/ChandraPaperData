We find that the distributions of the PAHs and dust are different from each other, both showing a significant deviation from a smooth stellar distribution. The PAH emission predominantly comes from a dust lane, a compact dense molecular gas region in the galactic center, where the PAHs are likely to have been protected from the interaction with the X-ray plasma. The dust emission has more extended structures, similar to the distribution of the X-ray plasma, suggesting their interaction to some extent.

In general, the distribution of dust probed in the mid-IR anticorrelates with the locations of massive star clusters that appear in the near-infrared. The 10-21 μm mid-IR emission, spatially integrated over the field of view, may be represented by hot dust with temperature of ̃ 160 K. Most discrete sources are found to have extended morphologies. Several radio H II regions are identified for the first time in the mid-IR.

We have compiled a comprehensive catalog of IC 348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. Our data collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excess indicating the presence of disks, Hα emission as a tracer of chromospheric emission or accretion, and mass accretion rates. <BR /> Results: We have detected 290 X-ray sources in four merged Chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated with known cluster members, which corresponds to a detection rate of ~60% for the cluster members of IC 348 that are identified in optical/infrared studies. According to the most recent spectral classification of IC 348 members, only four of the X-ray sources are brown dwarfs (spectral type M6 and later). The detection rate is highest for diskless Class III stars and increases with stellar mass. This may be explained with higher X-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evident in the X-ray luminosity functions. In particular, we find that for the lowest examined masses (0.1-0.25 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) there is a difference between the X-ray luminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on the basis of their Hα emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing and diskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energy distribution).

We simultaneously fit data from XMM-Newton EPIC-pn, MOS1, and MOS2 detectors with (nonthermal) powerlaw and (thermal) multicolored blackbody. <BR /> Results: The X-ray spectrum is best fit by the combination of a thermal component with kT ~ 1 keV and a powerlaw component with a photon index of approximately 2.6.

Basic stellar parameters and rotation rates are collected from the literature. This results in a sample of 82 X-ray detected stars with known rotation periods. We determine the Rossby numbers (i.e. the ratio of rotation period to convective turnover time) of 76 of these stars from stellar structure- and evolution-models for pre-main sequence stars. <BR /> Results: The young stars in IC 348 show no correlation between X-ray activity and rotation period. For the Rossby numbers, nearly all IC 348 stars are in the saturated regime of the activity-rotation relation defined by main-sequence stars. Searching for possible super-saturation effects, we find a marginal (but statistically in-significant) trend that the stars with the smallest Rossby numbers have slightly lower X-ray activity levels. There are no significant differences in the X-ray activity level for stars of different spectral types and no relation between spectral type and Rossby number is seen. In addition, for stars belonging to different IR-classes, no significant differences are present for the X-ray activity level as well as for their Rossby numbers. We compare the dispersion in the fractional X-ray luminosities of the stars in the saturated rotation regime in IC 348 to that seen in younger and older stellar populations.

Recently, diffuse and extended sources in TeV γ-rays as well as in X-rays have been detected in the direction of the Galactic globular cluster (GC) Terzan 5. Remarkably, this is among the brightest GCs detected in the GeV regime. The nature of either the TeV or the diffuse X-ray signal from Terzan 5 is not yet settled. These emissions most likely indicate the presence of several non-thermal radiation processes in addition to those that give rise to the GeV signal. <BR /> Aims: The aim of this work is to search for diffuse X-ray emission from all GeV-detected GCs where appropriate X-ray observations are available, and to compare the obtained results with the signal detected from Terzan 5. This study will help to determine whether Terzan 5 stands out among other GC or whether a whole population of globular clusters feature similar properties. <BR /> Methods: After assessing all archival X-ray observations of GeV detected GCs, we analyzed the data of six Chandra observations pointed toward M 62, NGC 6388, NGC 6541, M 28, M 80, and NGC 6139. For each GC we characterized the diffuse X-ray emission using the same analysis techniques as for Terzan 5. To study the emission on the same relative scales we used the half-mass radius as a scale parameter to determine the extent of the potential emission region. <BR /> Results: None of the six GCs show significant diffuse X-ray emission above the particle and diffuse Galactic X-ray background components. The derived upper limits allow to assess the validity of different models that were discussed in the interpretation of the multi-wavelength data of Terzan 5. A scenario based on synchrotron emission from relativistic leptons provided by the millisecond pulsar population cannot be securely rejected if a comparable magnetic field strength as in Terzan 5 is assumed for every GC. However, such a scenario seems to be unlikely for NGC 6388, and M 62. An inverse-Compton scenario relying on the presence of a putative GRB remnant with the same properties as proposed for Terzan 5 can be ruled out for all six GCs. Finally, the assumption that each GC hosts a source with the same luminosity as in Terzan 5 is ruled out for all GCs but NGC 6139.","keyword":["globular clusters: general","acceleration of particles","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal","pulsars: general","X-rays: diffuse background","gamma-ray burst: general","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

We also analysed archival X-ray data obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton. <BR /> Results: In all three optical bands, we detect a point-like source with V = 27.3 ± 0.3, R = 25.52 ± 0.07, and I = 24.13 ± 0.05, whose position is within the 1σ error circle of the X-ray position of the pulsar, and whose colours are distinct from those of ordinary stars. We consider it as a candidate optical counterpart of the pulsar.

The direction of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the pulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet. The tentative optical luminosity and efficiency of the pulsar are similar to those of the Vela pulsar, which also supports the optical identification. However, the candidate undergoes an unusually steep dereddened flux increase towards the infrared with a spectral index α<SUB>ν</SUB> ~ 5, that is not typical of optical pulsars. It implies a strong double-knee spectral break in the pulsar emission between the optical and X-rays. The reasons for the spectral steepness are unclear. It may be caused by a nebula knot projected onto the jet and strongly overlapping with the pulsar, as observed for the Crab, where the knot has a significantly steeper spectrum than the pulsar. We find no other signs of the pulsar nebula in the optical. Alternatively, the detected source may be a faint AGN, that has not yet been seen at other wavelengths. <BR /> Conclusions: The position and peculiar colours of the detected source suggest that it is an optical counterpart of the pulsar.

Accurate AGN host stellar mass estimates are obtained by decomposing their total emission into the stellar and the nuclear components.

We investigate the relative far-IR luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find a higher fraction of PACS detected, hence normal and highly star forming systems among AGN hosts. Although different interpretations are possible, we explain our findings as a consequence of a twofold AGN growth path: faint AGNs evolve through secular processes, with instantaneous AGNaccretion not tightly linked to the current total SF in the host galaxy, while the luminous AGNs co-evolve with their hosts through periods of enhanced AGN activity and star formation, possibly through major mergers. While an increased SF activity with respect to inactive galaxies of similar mass is expected in the latter, we interpret the modest SF offsets measured in low-L<SUB>X</SUB> AGN hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and SF histories in a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous SF and accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger) mechanisms.

Many methods to separate the two populations are used in the literature, based on X-ray and multiwavelength properties. We aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and to study the X-ray properties of the resulting samples. We build on a sample of galaxies selected at 1.4 GHz in the VLA-COSMOS survey, classified by Smolčić et al. (2008, ApJS, 177, 14) according to their optical colours and observed with Chandra. A similarly selected control sample of AGN is also used for comparison. We review some X-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the sample composition. The efficiency of the classification scheme devised by Smolčić et al. is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expected because of the higher X-ray brightness of AGN with respect to galaxies. The latter fraction is actually 50% in the X-ray detected sources, while it is expected to be much lower among X-ray undetected sources. Indeed, the analysis of the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, strongly different properties between the AGN and galaxy samples. X-ray based selection criteria are then used to refine both samples. The radio/X-ray luminosity correlation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the same X-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. Some evolution of the ratio may be possible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likely explained by a bias arising from the radio selection. Finally, we discuss the X-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the VLA- and C-COSMOS surveys according to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similar determination from the Chandra deep fields.

Line ratios in \"fir\" triplets of helium-like ions have proven to be a powerful diagnostic of conditions in X-ray emitting gas surrounding massive stars. Recent observations indicate that these ratios can be variable with time. <BR /> Aims: The possibilities for causes of variation in line ratios are limited: changes in the radiation field or changes in density, which would result in radiational or collisional level-pumping, respectively; and changes in mass-loss or geometry, which could cause variations in X-ray absorption effects. In this paper, we explore the first of these potential causes of variability: changes in the radiation field. We therefore explore the conditions necessary to induce variability in the ratio R = f / i via this mechanism. <BR /> Methods: To isolate the radiative effect, we use a heuristic model of temperature and radius changes in variable stars in the B and O range with low-density, steady-state winds. We then model the changes in emissivity of X-ray emitting gas close to the star due to differences in level-pumping owing to the availability of UV photons at the location of the gas. <BR /> Results: We find that under these conditions, variability in R is dominated by the stellar temperature. Although the relative amplitude of variability is roughly comparable for most lines at most temperatures, detectable variations are limited to a few lines for each spectral type. We predict that variable values in R due to stellar variability must follow predictable trends found in our simulations. <BR /> Conclusions: Our heuristic model uses radial pulsations as a mode of stellar variability that maximizes the amplitude of variation in R. This model is robust enough to provide a guide to which ions will provide the best opportunity for observing variability in the f / i ratio at different stellar temperatures, and the correlation of that variability with other observable parameters. In real systems, however, the effects would be more complex than in our model, with differences in phase and suppressed amplitude in the presence of non-radial pulsations. This, combined with the range of amplitudes produced in our simulations, suggests that changes in R across many lines concurrently are not likely to be produced by a variable radiation field.","keyword":["atomic processes","line: formation","line: profiles","radiation mechanisms: general","stars: early-type","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

The ~1700 year old PSR B0540-69 in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC) is considered the twin of the Crab pulsar because of its similar spin parameters, magnetic field, and energetics. PSR B0540-69 (V ~ 22.5) is also one of the very few pulsars for which both optical pulsations and polarised emission have been measured. Its optical spectrum is fit by a power-law, ascribed to synchrotron radiation, like for the young Crab and Vela pulsars. At variance with them, however, a double break is required to join the X-ray and optical power-law spectra, with the first one possibly occurring in the near ultraviolet (nUV). <BR /> Aims: Near-infrared (nIR) observations, never performed for PSR B0540-69, are crucial to determine whether the optical power-law spectrum extends to longer wavelengths or a new break occurs, like it happens for both the Crab and Vela pulsars in the mid-infrared (mIR), hinting at an even more complex particle energy and density distribution in the pulsar magnetosphere. <BR /> Methods: We observed PSR B0540-69 in the J, H, and K<SUB>S</SUB> bands with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to detect it, for the first time, in the nIR and characterise its optical-to-nIR spectrum. To disentangle the pulsar emission from that of its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), we obtained high-spatial resolution adaptive optics images with the NAOS-CONICA instrument (NACO). <BR /> Results: We could clearly identify PSR B0540-69 in our J, H, and K<SUB>S</SUB>-band images and measure its flux (J = 20.14, H = 19.33, K<SUB>S</SUB> = 18.55, with an overall error of ± 0.1 mag in each band). The joint fit to the available optical and nIR photometry with a power-law spectrum F<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>-α</SUP> gives a spectral index α = 0.70 ± 0.04, slightly more precise than measured in the optical only. This clearly implies that there is no spectral break between the optical and the nIR. We also detected, for the first time, the PSR B0540-69 PWN in the nIR. The comparison between our NACO images and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical ones does not reveal any apparent difference in the PWN morphology as a function of wavelength. The PWN optical-to-nIR spectrum is also fit by a single power-law, with spectral index α = 0.56 ± 0.03, slightly flatter than the pulsar's. <BR /> Conclusions: Using NACO at the VLT, we obtained the first detection of PSR B0540-69 and its PWN in the nIR.

The surface densities of the dark matter halos are higher than those of spiral galaxies.

The use of three fields with differing areas and depths enables us to explore trends between the global FIR luminosity of the AGN hosts and the luminosity of the active nucleus across 4.5 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity (L<SUB>AGN</SUB>) and spanning redshifts from the Local Universe to z = 2.5. Using imaging from the Herschel/PACS instrument in 2-3 bands, we combine FIR detections and stacks of undetected objects to arrive at mean fluxes for subsamples in bins of redshift and X-ray luminosity. We constrain the importance of AGN-heated dust emission in the FIR and confirm that the majority of the FIR emission of AGNs is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation in their host galaxies. We uncover characteristic trends between the mean FIR luminosity (L<SUB>60</SUB>) and accretion luminosity of AGNs, which depend both on L<SUB>AGN</SUB> and redshift. At low AGN luminosities, accretion and SFR are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenario where most low-luminosity AGNs are primarily fueled by secular processes in their host galaxies. At high AGN luminosities, a significant correlation is observed between L<SUB>60</SUB> and L<SUB>AGN</SUB>, but only among AGNs at low and moderate redshifts (z 〈 1). We interpret this observation as a sign of the increasing importance of major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high AGN luminosities. We also find evidence that the enhancement of SFR in luminous AGNs weakens or disappears at high redshifts (z 〉 1) suggesting that the role of mergers is less important at these epochs. At all redshifts, we find essentially no relationship between L<SUB>60</SUB> and nuclear obscuration across five orders of magnitude in obscuring Hydrogen column density (N<SUB>H</SUB>), suggesting that various mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring X-rays in active galaxies. We discuss a broad scenario which can account for these trends: one in which two different modes of AGN fueling operate in the low- and high-luminosity regimes of SMBH accretion. We postulate that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity AGNs evolves with redshift.

The spectra of both stars are analyzed, together with an archival Chandra spectrum of another DA white dwarf (<ASTROBJ>GD 246</ASTROBJ>). <BR /> Aims: The soft X-ray spectra of the two DA white dwarfs are investigated in order to study the effect of gravitational settling and radiative levitation of metals in their photospheres. <ASTROBJ>LB 1919</ASTROBJ> is of interest because it has a significantly lower metallicity than DAs with otherwise similar atmospheric parameters. <ASTROBJ>GD 246</ASTROBJ> is the only white dwarf known that shows identifiable individual iron lines in the soft X-ray range. For the PG 1159 star, a precise effective temperature determination is performed in order to confine the position of the blue edge of the GW Vir instability region in the HRD. <BR /> Methods: The Chandra spectra are analyzed with chemically homogeneous as well as stratified NLTE model atmospheres that assume equilibrium between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration of chemical elements. Archival EUV and UV spectra obtained with EUVE, FUSE, and HST are utilized to support the analysis. <BR /> Results: No metals could be identified in LB 1919. All observations are compatible with a pure hydrogen atmosphere. This is in stark contrast to the vast majority of hot DA white dwarfs that exhibit light and heavy metals and to the stratified models that predict significant metal abundances in the atmosphere. For GD 246 we find that neither stratified nor homogeneous models can fit the Chandra spectrum. The Chandra spectrum of PG 1520+525 constrains the effective temperature to T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 150 000 ± 10 000 K. Therefore, this nonpulsating star together with the pulsating prototype of the GW Vir class (PG 1159 - 035) defines the location of the blue edge of the GW Vir instability region. The result is in accordance with predictions from nonadiabatic stellar pulsation models. Such models are therefore reliable tools to investigate the interior structure of GW Vir variables. <BR /> Conclusions: Our soft X-ray study reveals that the understanding of metal abundances in hot DA white dwarf atmospheres is still incomplete.

We introduce a Bayesian model to address all these issues at the same time, thus allowing cross-talk (covariance). On simulated data, the Bayesian fit recovers the input enrichment history, unlike in standard analysis. After accounting for a possible dependence on X-ray temperature, for metal abundance systematics, and for the intrinsic variety of studied objects, we found that the present-day metal content is not reached either at high or at low redshifts, but gradually over time: iron abundance increases by a factor 1.5 in the 7 Gyr sampled by the data. Therefore, feedback in metal abundance does not end at high redshift. Evolution is established with a moderate amount of evidence, 19 to 1 odds against faster or slower metal enrichment histories. We quantify, for the first time, the intrinsic spread in metal abundance, 18 ± 3%, after correcting for the effect of evolution, X-ray temperature, and metal abundance systematics.

We have used HST-STIS spectral images along the major and minor axes of Haro 2 to characterize the Lyα emission, as well as FOC UV, WFPC-2 optical and NICMOS near infrared broadband-filter images to analyze the properties of the stellar population. WFPC-2 Hα image and ground-based spectroscopy allow us to study the Balmer emission lines. Finally, Chandra/ACIS X-ray images provide resolved distribution of the X-ray emission at various energy bands. The observational data are analyzed by comparison with the predictions from evolutionary synthesis models to constrain the properties of the star formation episode. <BR /> Results: The UV, Hα and far infrared luminosities of the Haro 2 nuclear starburst are well reproduced assuming a young stellar population with ages ~3.5-5.0 Myr, affected by differential intestellar extinctions. A significant fraction of the stars are completely obscured in the UV, being identifiable only indirectly by their contribution to the ionization of the gas and to the far infrared emission. The diffuse soft X-ray emission extending over the whole source is attributed to gas heated by the mechanical energy released by the starburst. A compact hard X-ray emission (likely an UltraLuminous X-ray source) has been identified in a star-forming condensation to the southeast. Both compact and diffuse Lyα emission components are observed along the major and minor axes in STIS spectral images. Lyα is spatially decoupled from Balmer lines emission, Balmer decrement and UV continuum. However, the diffuse Lyα component is spatially correlated with the diffuse soft X-ray emission. Moreover, unlike the compact Lyα emission, diffuse Lyα shows luminosities larger than predicted from Hα, assuming case B recombination and considering the dust extinction as derived from Hα/Hβ. <BR /> Conclusions: The Lyα emission closely associated to the massive stellar clusters is strongly affected by the properties of the surrounding neutral gas (presence of outflows, dust abundance), leading to even a range of escape fractions at different locations within the same starburst.

The dying radio sources represent a very interesting and largely unexplored stage of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) evolution. They are considered to be very rare, and almost all of the few known ones were found in galaxy clusters. However, considering the small number detected so far, it has not been possible to draw any firm conclusions about their X-ray environment. <BR /> Aims: We present X-ray observations performed with the Chandra satellite of the three galaxy clusters Abell 2276, ZwCl 1829.3+6912, and RX J1852.1+5711, which harbor at their center a dying radio source with an ultra-steep spectrum that we recently discovered. <BR /> Methods: We analyzed the physical properties of the X-ray emitting gas surrounding these elusive radio sources. We determined the global X-ray properties of the clusters, derived the azimuthally averaged profiles of metal abundance, gas temperature, density, and pressure. Furthermore, we estimated the total mass profiles. <BR /> Results: The large-scale X-ray emission is regular and spherical, suggesting a relaxed state for these systems. Indeed, we found that the three clusters are also characterized by significant enhancements in the metal abundance and declining temperature profiles toward the central region. For all these reasons, we classified RX J1852.1+5711, Abell 2276, and ZwCl 1829.3+6912 as cool-core galaxy clusters. <BR /> Conclusions: We calculated the non-thermal pressure of the radio lobes assuming that the radio sources are in the minimum energy condition. For all dying sources we found that this is on average about one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the external gas, as found for many other radio sources at the center of galaxy groups and clusters. We found marginal evidence for the presence of X-ray surface brightness depressions coincident with the fossil radio lobes of the dying sources in A2276 and ZwCl 1829.3+691. We estimated the outburst age and energy output for these two dying sources. The energy power from the AGN outburst is significantly higher than the X-ray luminosity in both clusters. Indeed, it is sufficient that a small fraction of this power is dissipated in the intra-cluster medium to reheat the cool cores.Appendix is available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org\">http://www.aanda.org</A>","keyword":["X-rays: galaxies: clusters","galaxies: active","galaxies: clusters: general","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

Among these, photo-evaporation caused by strong X-ray emission from the central star is probably significant. Several aspects of the X-ray emission from coronae and accretion shocks remain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronal emission. <BR /> Aims: We studied the X-ray variability of ~1 Myr old low-mass PMS stars as a function of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics to gain insights into the working of PMS coronae, their X-ray emission, and the circumstellar environment in which they are immersed. <BR /> Methods: We have exploited the ~850 ks long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained by the COUP collaboration in January 2003, and statistically analyzed the X-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. Our main focus was to characterize the different X-ray behavior of stars with and without circumstellar accretion disks, and to infer the physical mechanism responsible for the observed variability. <BR /> Results: Accreting stars (classical T Tauri stars, CTTSs) are found to be more variable than non-accreting stars (weak-line T Tauri stars, WTTSs) at all timescales and in all X-ray energy bands considered.

Signatures of rotational modulation are observed for both CTTSs and WTTSs, and most clearly for CTTSs in the soft X-ray band. Lower mass stars are more variable than higher mass stars. <BR /> Conclusions: We propose that the difference in variability between CTTSs and WTTSs may be explained assuming that the X-ray emission of CTTS is affected by time-variable absorption due to circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/or accretion streams. This suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis that the coronae of CTTSs and WTTSs are similar, it may also explain why CTTSs have lower and more scattered X-ray emission levels compared to WTTSs.Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org\">http://www.aanda.org</A>","keyword":["stars: activity","stars: coronae","stars: variables: T Tauri","Herbig Ae/Be","stars: formation","accretion","accretion disks","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer imaging of a nearby suspected pulsar and time-variable γ-ray source (GeV J1809-2327) detected 21 X-ray sources in the cluster vicinity, some of which are coincident with the early-type stars and Hα emitters in IC 1274.

Our interpretation of the structure of IC 1274 and the spatial distribution of Hα emitters is that the early-type stars formed recently and are in the process of ionizing and dispersing the molecular gas on the near surface of L227. The displaced material was driven against what remains of the molecular cloud to the east, enabling the formation of the substantial number of T Tauri stars found there. A dispersed population of Hα emitters is also found along the periphery of L227, IC 1275, and IC 4684. These sources, if pre-main-sequence stars, appear to have formed in relative isolation compared to the dense cluster environment of IC 1274 or, alternatively, may be older and have drifted further from their formation sites. We identify a V ~ 21.5 star very near the position of X-ray source 5, the assumed γ-ray source and young pulsar candidate.

The aim of the three previous papers was to explore the connection between the host galaxies and AGN activity in a radio-selected sample. We detect nuclear X-ray emission in eight sources and radio emission in all but one (viz., UGC 6985). The new VLA observations improve the spatial resolution by a factor of 10: the presence of nuclear radio sources in 12 of the 13 galaxies confirms their AGN nature. As previously indicated, the behavior of the X-ray and radio emission in these sources depends strongly on the form of their optical surface brightness profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, i.e., on their classification as \"core,\" \"power-law,\" or \"intermediate\" galaxies. With more than twice the number of \"power-law\" and \"intermediate\" galaxies compared to previous work, we confirm with a much higher statistical significance that these galaxies lie well above the radio-X-ray correlation established in Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxies and the low-luminosity \"core\" galaxies. This result highlights the fact that the \"radio-loud/radio-quiet\" dichotomy is a function of the host galaxy's optical surface brightness profile.

We find a possible enhancement of a factor of ~2-4 in the number of ULXs per blue luminosity for the strongly interacting subset. Such an enhancement would be expected if ULX production is related to star formation, as interacting galaxies tend to have enhanced star formation rates on average. For most of the Arp galaxies in our sample, the total number of ULXs compared to the far-infrared luminosity is consistent with values found earlier for spiral galaxies. This suggests that for these galaxies, ULXs trace recent star formation. However, for the most infrared-luminous galaxies, we find a deficiency of ULXs compared to the infrared luminosity. For these very infrared-luminous galaxies, active galactic nuclei may contribute to powering the far-infrared; alternatively, ULXs may be highly obscured in the X-ray in these galaxies and therefore not detected by these Chandra observations. We determined local UV/optical colors within the galaxies in the vicinity of the candidate ULXs using Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV and Sloan Digitized Sky Survey optical images. In most cases, the distributions of colors are similar to the global colors of interacting galaxies.

M 87 has been established as a VHE γ-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE γ-ray emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this paper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and VERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE was detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays (Chandra), and radio (43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array, VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE γ-ray light curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the flare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential function with significantly different flux rise and decay times of τ<SUP>rise</SUP> <SUB>d</SUB> = (1.69 ± 0.30) days and τ<SUP>decay</SUP> <SUB>d</SUB> = (0.611 ± 0.080) days, respectively. While the overall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from that of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar timescales (~day), peak fluxes (Φ<SUB>〉0.35 TeV</SUB> ~= (1-3) × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and VHE spectra. VLBA radio observations of 43 GHz of the inner jet regions indicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an increase of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE flare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the peak of the VHE γ-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core (flux increased by factor ~2; variability timescale 〈2 days). The long-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength (MWL) light curve of M 87, spanning from radio to VHE and including data from Hubble Space Telescope, Liverpool Telescope, Very Large Array, and European VLBI Network, is used to further investigate the origin of the VHE γ-ray emission. No unique, common MWL signature of the three VHE flares has been identified. In the outer kiloparsec jet region, in particular in HST-1, no enhanced MWL activity was detected in 2008 and 2010, disfavoring it as the origin of the VHE flares during these years. Shortly after two of the three flares (2008 and 2010), the X-ray core was observed to be at a higher flux level than its characteristic range (determined from more than 60 monitoring observations: 2002-2009). In 2005, the strong flux dominance of HST-1 could have suppressed the detection of such a feature. Published models for VHE γ-ray emission from M 87 are reviewed in the light of the new data.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: individual: M 87","galaxies: jets","galaxies: nuclei","gamma rays: galaxies","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

NGC 922 is a drop-through ring galaxy with an expanding ring of star formation, similar in many respects to the Cartwheel galaxy. The Cartwheel galaxy is famous for hosting 12 ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), most of which are in the star-forming ring. This is the largest number of ULXs seen in a single system and has led to speculation that the low metallicity of the Cartwheel (0.3 Z <SUB>☉</SUB>) may optimize the conditions for ULX formation. In contrast, NGC 922 has metallicity near solar. The Chandra observations reveal a population of bright X-ray sources, including seven ULXs. The number of ULXs in NGC 922 and the Cartwheel scales with the star formation rate: we do not find any evidence for an excess of sources in the Cartwheel. Simulations of the binary population in these galaxies suggest that the ULX population in both systems is dominated by systems with strong wind accretion from supergiant donors onto direct-collapse black holes. The simulations correctly predict the ratio of the number of sources in NGC 922 and the Cartwheel. Thus, it would appear that the metallicity of the Cartwheel is not low enough to see a difference in the ULX population compared to NGC 922.","keyword":["galaxies: individual: NGC 922","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

These observations reveal X-ray and optical emissions from the jets in both sources. X-ray emission is detected from the entire length of the 0106+013 radio jet, which shows clear bends or wiggles—the X-ray emission is brightest at the first prominent kiloparsec jet bend. A picture of a helical kiloparsec jet with the first kiloparsec-scale bend representing a jet segment moving close(r) to our line of sight, and getting Doppler boosted at both radio and X-ray frequencies, is consistent with these observations. The X-ray emission from the jet end, however, peaks at about 0farcs4 (~3.4 kpc) upstream of the radio hot spot. Optical emission is detected both at the X-ray jet termination peak and at the radio hot spot. The X-ray jet termination peak is found upstream of the radio hot spot by around 0farcs2 (~1.3 kpc) in the short projected jet of 3C 345. HST optical emission is seen in an arc-like structure coincident with the bright radio hot spot, which we propose is a sharp (apparent) jet bend instead of a terminal point, that crosses our line of sight and consequently has a higher Doppler beaming factor. A weak radio hot spot is indeed observed less than 1'' downstream of the bright radio hot spot, but has no optical or X-ray counterpart. By making use of the parsec-scale radio and the kiloparsec-scale radio/X-ray data, we derive constraints on the jet Lorentz factors (Γ<SUB>jet</SUB>) and inclination angles (θ): for a constant jet speed from parsec to kiloparsec scales, we obtain a Γ<SUB>jet</SUB> of ~70 for 0106+013 and ~40 for 3C 345. On relaxing this assumption, we derive a Γ<SUB>jet</SUB> of ~2.5 for both the sources. Upper limits on θ of ~13° are obtained for the two quasars. Broadband (radio-optical-X-ray) spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of individual jet components in both quasars suggests that the optical emission is from the synchrotron mechanism, while the X-rays are produced via the inverse Compton mechanism from relativistically boosted cosmic microwave background seed photons. The locations of the upstream X-ray termination peaks strongly suggest that the sites of bulk jet deceleration lie upstream (by a few kiloparsecs) of the radio hot spots in these quasars. These regions are also the sites of shocks or magnetic field dissipation, which reaccelerate charged particles and produce high-energy optical and X-ray photons. This is consistent with the best-fit SED modeling parameters of magnetic field strength and electron power-law indices being higher in the jet termination regions compared to the cores. The shocked jet regions upstream of the radio hot spots, the kiloparsec-scale jet wiggles and a \"nose cone\"-like jet structure in 0106+013, and the V-shaped radio structure in 3C 345, are all broadly consistent with instabilities associated with Poynting-flux-dominated jets.

However, cosmologically distant low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) have remained a challenge to identify due to significant contribution from the host galaxy. We identify long-term X-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 CDF-S galaxies spanning redshifts z ≈ 0.08-1.02 that do not meet other AGN selection criteria. We show that the observed variability cannot be explained by X-ray binary populations or ultraluminous X-ray sources, so the variability is most likely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The variable galaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effective power-law photon index of Γ<SUB>stack</SUB> ≈ 1.93 ± 0.13, and are therefore likely LLAGNs. The LLAGNs tend to lie a factor of ≈6-80 below the extrapolated linear variability-luminosity relation measured for luminous AGNs. This may be explained by their lower accretion rates. Variability-independent black hole mass and accretion-rate estimates for variable galaxies show that they sample a significantly different black hole mass-accretion-rate space, with masses a factor of 2.4 lower and accretion rates a factor of 22.5 lower than variable luminous AGNs at the same redshift. We find that an empirical model based on a universal broken power-law power spectral density function, where the break frequency depends on SMBH mass and accretion rate, roughly reproduces the shape, but not the normalization, of the variability-luminosity trends measured for variable galaxies and more luminous AGNs.","keyword":["galaxies: active","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Our sample consists of 21 sources with polarized hidden broad lines and 18 sources without hidden broad lines.

The ratio between the bolometric luminosity, derived from the intrinsic (i.e., unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, and the Eddington luminosity is a measure of the rate at which matter accretes onto the central supermassive black hole. A separation between Compton-thin HBLR and non-HBLR sources is clear, both in accretion rate (log L <SUB>bol</SUB>/L <SUB>Edd</SUB> = -1.9) and in luminosity (log L <SUB>bol</SUB> = 43.90). When properly luminosity-corrected Compton-thick sources are included, the separation between HBLR and non-HBLR is less sharp but no HBLR source falls below the Eddington ratio threshold. We speculate that non-HBLR Compton-thick sources with accretion rate higher than the threshold do possess a BLR, but something, probably related to their heavy absorption, is preventing us from observing it even in polarized light. Our results for Compton-thin sources support theoretical expectations. In a model presented by Nicastro, the presence of broad emission lines is intrinsically connected with disk instabilities occurring in proximity of a transition radius, which is a function of the accretion rate, becoming smaller than the innermost stable orbit for very low accretion rates and therefore luminosities.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: Seyfert","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

In order to examine the jet contribution to the X-ray flux, we model the quasar spectral energy distribution, adopting several scenarios for the jet emission. For the values of the main physical parameters favored by the observables, a dominant role of the jet emission in the X-ray band is ruled out when a single-zone (leptonic) scenario is adopted, even including the contribution of the external photon fields as seed photons for inverse Compton emission. We then consider a structured jet, with the blazar component that—although not directly visible in the X-ray band—provides an intense field of seed synchrotron photons Compton-scattered by electrons in a mildly relativistic knot. In this case, the whole X-ray emission can be accounted for if we assume a blazar luminosity within the range observed from flat spectrum radio quasars. The X-ray radiative efficiency of such a (structured) jet is intimately related to the presence of a complex velocity structure. The jet emission can provide a significant contribution in X-rays if it decelerates within the host galaxy on kiloparsec scales.

The brightest X-ray point source detected in this field of view is also the one located closest to the geometrical center of G308.3-1.4, which has a soft spectrum. The intriguing temporal variability and the identification of the optical/infrared counterpart rule out the possibility of an isolated neutron star. On the other hand, the spectral energy distribution from the K<SUB>s</SUB> band to the R band suggests a late-type star. Together with a putative periodicity of ~1.4 hr, the interesting excesses in the V and B bands and in Hα suggest that this source is a promising candidate for a compact binary that survived a supernova explosion.","keyword":["ISM: supernova remnants","X-rays: individual: G308.3-1.4","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

To date, this spectrum is the only definitive evidence of an ionized wind driven off the accretion disk by magnetic processes in a black hole X-ray binary. Here we present our detailed spectral analysis of the first Chandra observation, nearly three weeks earlier, in which the only signature of the wind is the Fe XXVI absorption line. Comparing the broadband X-ray spectra via photoionization models, we argue that the differences in the Chandra spectra cannot possibly be explained by the changes in the ionizing spectrum, which implies that the properties of the wind cannot be constant throughout the outburst. We explore physical scenarios for the changes in the wind, which we suggest may begin as a hybrid MHD/thermal wind, but evolves over the course of weeks into two distinct outflows with different properties.

The morphology of the SNR, as seen in the mid-infrared, resembles that seen in X-rays with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Most of the mid-infrared emission in the MIPS images is produced by circumstellar dust heated in the non-radiative shocks around G292.0+1.8, confirming the results of earlier mid-IR observations with AKARI. In addition to emission from hot dust, we have also mapped atomic line emission between 14 μm and 36 μm using IRS spectral maps. The line emission is primarily associated with the bright oxygen-rich optical knots, but is also detected from fast-moving knots of ejecta. We confirm our earlier detection of 15-25 μm emission characteristic of magnesium silicate dust in spectra of the radiatively shocked ejecta. We do not detect silicon line emission from any of the radiatively shocked ejecta in the southeast of the SNR, possibly because the reverse shock has not yet penetrated most of the Si-rich ejecta in that region.

The absence of a similar periodicity in the Hα flux and the total X-ray flux which are dominated by accretion processes and the stellar corona, respectively, points to a different source of photometric variations. The Hα emission line appears intrinsically broad and symmetric, and both the profile and its variability suggest an origin in the post-shock cooling region. An accretion event, signaled by soft X-rays, is traced spectroscopically for the first time through the optical emission line profiles. After the accretion event, downflowing turbulent material observed in the Hα and Hβ lines is followed by He I (λ5876) broadening near the photosphere. Optical veiling resulting from the heated photosphere increases with a delay of ~2 hr after the X-ray accretion event. The response of the stellar coronal emission to an increase in the veiling follows ~2.4 hr later, giving direct evidence that the stellar corona is heated in part by accretion. Subsequently, the stellar wind becomes re-established. We suggest a model that incorporates the dynamics of this sequential series of events: an accretion shock, a cooling downflow in a supersonically turbulent region, followed by photospheric and later, coronal heating. This model naturally explains the presence of broad optical and ultraviolet lines, and affects the mass accretion rates determined from emission line profiles.","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","stars: individual: TW Hydrae","stars: pre-main sequence","stars: variables: T Tauri","Herbig Ae/Be","stars: winds","outflows","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

This observation represents the first high-resolution spectrum taken for this source as well as the longest uninterrupted observation of any γ Cas analog. The Chandra light curve shows a high variability but its analysis fails to detect any coherent periodicity up to a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Hardness ratio versus intensity analyses demonstrate that the relative contributions of the [1.5-3] Å, [3-6] Å, and [6-16] Å energy bands to the total flux change rapidly in the short term. The analysis of the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) spectrum shows that, to correctly describe the spectrum, three model components are needed. Two of those components are optically thin thermal plasmas of different temperatures (kT ≈ 8-9 and 0.2-0.3 keV, respectively) described by the models vmekal or bvapec. The Fe abundance in each of these two components appears equal within the errors and is slightly subsolar with Z ≈ 0.75 Z <SUB>☉</SUB>. The bvapec model better describes the Fe L transitions, although it cannot fit well the Na XI Lyα line at 10.02 Å, which appears to be overabundant. Two different models seem to describe well the third component. One possibility is a third hot optically thin thermal plasma at kT = 16-21 keV with an Fe abundance Z ≈ 0.3 Z <SUB>☉</SUB>, definitely smaller than for the other two thermal components. Furthermore, the bvapec model describes well the Fe K shell transitions because it accounts for the turbulence broadening of the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI lines with a v <SUB>turb</SUB> ≈ 1200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. These two lines, contributed mainly by the hot thermal plasma, are significantly wider than the Fe Kα line whose FWHM 〈 5 mÅ is not resolved by Chandra. Alternatively, the third component can be described by a power law with a photon index of Γ = 1.56. In either case, the Chandra HETG spectrum establishes that each one of these components must be modified by distinct absorption columns. The analysis of a noncontemporaneous 25 ks Suzaku observation shows the presence of a hard tail extending up to at least 33 keV. The Suzaku spectrum is described with the sum of two components: an optically thin thermal plasma at kT ≈ 9 keV and Z ≈ 0.74 Z <SUB>☉</SUB>, and a very hot second plasma with kT ≈ 33 keV or, alternatively, a power law with photon index of Γ = 1.58. In either case, each one of the two components must be affected by different absorption columns. Therefore, the kT = 8-9 keV component is definitely needed while the nature of the harder emission cannot be unambiguously established with the present data sets.

This amounts to strong evidence that all M dwarfs should exhibit the inverse FIP effect phenomenon, not just the active ones. We take the first step toward modeling the inverse FIP phenomenon in M dwarfs, building on past work that has demonstrated that MHD waves coursing through coronal loops can lead to a ponderomotive force that fractionates elements in a manner consistent with the FIP effect.

We analytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong constraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which propagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing, quasi-spiral, tangential discontinuity surface.

Many mid-IR color-color criteria have been explored to accomplish this goal and tested thoroughly in the literature. Besides missing many low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), one of the main conclusions is that, with increasing redshift, the contamination by non-active galaxies becomes significant (especially at z 〉~ 2.5). This is problematic for the study of the AGN phenomenon in the early universe, the main goal of many of the current and future deep extragalactic surveys. In this work new near- and mid-IR color diagnostics are explored, aiming for improved efficiency—better completeness and less contamination—in selecting AGNs out to very high redshifts. We restrict our study to the James Webb Space Telescope wavelength range (0.6-27 μm). The criteria are created based on the predictions by state-of-the-art galaxy and AGN templates covering a wide variety of galaxy properties, and tested against control samples with deep multi-wavelength coverage (ranging from the X-rays to radio frequencies).

However, the necessary testing constraints and the small control-sample sizes prevent the confirmation of its improved efficiency at z 〉~ 2.5. Overall, KIM shows a ~30%-40% completeness and a 〉70%-90% level of successful AGN selection.

In this paper, we compare ellipticity profiles of simulated clusters performed with varying input physics (radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback) to the cluster ellipticity profiles derived from Chandra and ROSAT observations, in an effort to constrain the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into the central galaxies within clusters.

The spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse X-ray emission are highly suggestive that it is generated by the post-born-again and present fast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen-poor ejecta of the born-again event. This emission can be attributed to shock-heated plasma, as the hydrogen-poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds, under which circumstances the efficient mass loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its density and damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft X-rays. Charge transfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of the born-again ejecta have also been considered as a possible mechanism for the production of diffuse X-ray emission, and upper limits on the expected X-ray production by this mechanism have been derived.

The former is able to explain the detected signal of G2 in the position-velocity (PV) diagram of the Brγ emission of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5 data.

This is one of only five remnants in the LMC with an identified PWN. We find that the shell of emission is not ejecta dominated, but rather due to shocked interstellar medium that has been swept up by the supernova (SN) blast wave or located in a precursor cavity wall. This is supported by the morphology of the local molecular cloud as seen with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectral properties are consistent with a middle-aged remnant 〉17,000 years old. A probable point source within the central knot is determined to be the pulsar powering the synchrotron emission of the PWN. Spectral fits show the nebula is well characterized by a power law with photon index Γ = 2.0. This index is constant over a spatial scale of 0.4-1.2 pc, which is inconsistent with younger PWN containing remnants such as the Crab Nebula and SNR 0540-69.3. These fits also contain significant contributions from an ejecta-dominated thermal plasma which we interpret as evidence of mixing during an evolved interaction of the PWN with the reverse shock of the supernova remnant.

This allows us, for the first time, to investigate the role of X-rays on the wind structure in a bona fide weak-wind system and to determine whether there actually is a massive hot wind. The X-ray emission measure indicates that the outflow is an order of magnitude greater than that derived from UV lines and is commensurate with the nominal wind-luminosity relationship for O stars. Therefore, the \"weak-wind problem\"—identified from cool wind UV/optical spectra—is largely resolved by accounting for the hot wind seen in X-rays. From X-ray line profiles, Doppler shifts, and relative strengths, we find that this weak-wind star is typical of other late O dwarfs. The X-ray spectra do not suggest a magnetically confined plasma—the spectrum is soft and lines are broadened; Suzaku spectra confirm the lack of emission above 2 keV. Nor do the relative line shifts and widths suggest any wind decoupling by ions. The He-like triplets indicate that the bulk of the X-ray emission is formed rather close to the star, within five stellar radii. Our results challenge the idea that some OB stars are \"weak-wind\" stars that deviate from the standard wind-luminosity relationship. The wind is not weak, but it is hot and its bulk is only detectable in X-rays.","keyword":["stars: early-type","stars: individual: mu Col","stars: mass-loss","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

We report on a series of 20 Suzaku observations of Cygnus X-1 made in the jet-producing low/hard state. Contemporaneous radio monitoring was done using the Arcminute MicroKelvin Array radio telescope. Two important and simple results are obtained: (1) the jet (as traced by radio flux) does not appear to be modulated by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk and (2) the jet is sensitive to disk properties, including its flux, temperature, and ionization. Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a coupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected X-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection model of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.

The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high probability of containing AGNs. Their [O III] λ5007 emission line is strongly excited, inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation (SF) alone. [Ne III] λ3869 excitation is also higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive Chandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which confirms the presence of AGNs. The clumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of gas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the main sequence of SF. This suggests that our findings apply to the physically similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z 〉 1.

No counterpart was detected in deep optical imaging with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope down to a 3σ lower limit of g = 26.5 mag. This source has previously been identified as a black hole X-ray binary in M31. While this remains a possibility, the transient behavior, X-ray spectrum, and lack of an optical counterpart are equally consistent with a magnetar interpretation for 2XMMi J003833.3+402133. The derived luminosity and blackbody emitting radius at the distance of M31 argue against an extragalactic location, implying that if it is indeed a magnetar it is located within the Milky Way but 22° out of the plane. The high Galactic latitude could be explained if 2XMMi J003833.3+402133 were an old magnetar, or if its progenitor was a runaway star that traveled away from the plane prior to going supernova.","keyword":["galaxies: individual: M31","stars: neutron","X-rays: individual: 2XMMi J003833.3+402133","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Direct evidence for highly ionized, Compton-thin inner-disk winds comes from observations of blueshifted (v ~ 0.05-0.1c) iron-K X-ray absorption lines. However, it has been suggested that the inner regions of black hole accretion disks can also drive Compton-thick winds—such winds would enshroud the inner disk, preventing us from seeing direct signatures of the accretion disk (i.e., the photospheric thermal emission, or the Doppler/gravitationally broadened iron Kα line). Here, we show that, provided the source is sub-Eddington, the well-established wind-driving mechanisms fail to launch a Compton-thick wind from the inner disk. For the accelerated region of the wind to be Compton-thick, the momentum carried in the wind must exceed the available photon momentum by a factor of at least 2/λ, where λ is the Eddington ratio of the source, ruling out radiative acceleration unless the source is very close to the Eddington limit. Compton-thick winds also carry large mass fluxes, and a consideration of the connections between the wind and the disk shows this to be incompatible with magneto-centrifugal driving. Finally, thermal driving of the wind is ruled out on the basis of the large Compton radii that typify black hole systems.

These new-generation X-ray observatories provide particularly high spectral resolution and high density in monitoring campaigns, simultaneously in X-rays and UV/optical. The entire evolution of several nova outbursts has been observed with the Swift XRT and UVOT instruments, allowing studies of the gradual shift of the peak of the SED from UV to X-rays, time scales to the onset and duration of the X-ray brightest supersoft source (SSS) phase, and pre- and post-SSS X-ray emission. In addition, XMM-Newton and Chandra observations can efficiently be scheduled, allowing deeper studies of strategically chosen evolutionary stages. Before Swift joined in 2005, Chandra and XMM-Newton blind shots in search of SSS emission unavoidably led to some underexposed observations taken before and/or after the SSS phase. More systematic Swift studies reduced this number while increasing the number of novae. Pre- and post-SSS spectra at low and high spectral resolution were successfully modelled with collisional plasma models. Pre-SSS emission arises in shocks and post-SSS emission in radiatively cooling thin ejecta. In contrast, the grating spectra taken during the SSS phase are a lot more complex than expected and have not yet been successfully modeled. Available hot white dwarf (WD) radiation transport models give only approximate reproduction of the observations, and make some critical assumptions that are only valid in isolated WDs. More grating spectra would be important to search for systematic trends between SSS spectra and system parameters.Summary of well-established discoveries with Swift, XMM-Newton, and Chandra:- About 50% of novae display faint X-ray emission before the start of the SSS phase- The start of the SSS phase is not a smooth process. High-amplitude variations during the early SSS phase were seen that disappear  close to the time when the optical plateau phase begins.- The end of the SSS phase is in most cases a smooth process.- The SSS grating spectra contain continuum spectra that roughly resemble a blackbody shape- The SSS X-ray grating spectra of systems with known high inclination angles contain emission lines on top of the continuum- The SSS X-ray spectra of systems with unknown or low inclination angles contain deep absorption lines from the interstellar medium and local, high-ionisation absorption lines that are blue shifted.","keyword":["novae","cataclysmic variables","stars: individual (RS Oph)","stars: individual (V4743 Sgr)","stars: individual (V382 Vel)","stars: individual (V458 Vul)","stars: individual (V2491 Cyg)","stars: individual (V723 Cas)","stars: individual (U Sco)","stars: individual (V1494 Aql)","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

The availability of redshifts for ̃95 per cent of the sources in our sample allows us to derive reliable luminosity estimates and the intrinsic properties from X-ray analysis for the majority of the objects. With the aim of selecting sources powered by star formation in both bands, we adopt classification criteria based on X-ray and radio data, exploiting the X-ray spectral features and time variability, taking advantage of observations scattered across more than 10 years. We identify 43 objects consistent with being powered by star formation. We also add another 111 and 70 star-forming candidates detected only in the radio and X-ray bands, respectively. We find a clear linear correlation between radio and X-ray luminosity in star-forming galaxies over three orders of magnitude and up to z̃ 1.5. We also measure a significant scatter of the order of 0.4 dex, higher than that observed at low redshift, implying an intrinsic scatter component.

Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20 μm silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs exhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disc, compared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our targets, we find a flat disc structure, which is consistent with the stronger signs of dust processing observed in these discs. For the case of one brown dwarf, 2M04230607, we find the forsterite mass fraction to be a factor of ̃3 higher in the outer disc compared to the inner disc region. Simple large-scale radial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical composition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in this disc. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer cold regions of brown dwarf discs provides an interesting analogy to comets. In this context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms that have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transport of high-temperature material.

We validate this method by analysing the Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital motion (K<SUB>BH</SUB>= 90.8 ± 11.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) inferred from the Doppler velocity of disc wind absorption lines is consistent with the prediction from its previously measured system parameters. We thus estimate its black hole mass (?) and then its system inclination (?), where M<SUB>BH</SUB> does not depend on i. Additional observations of this source covering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters substantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3 observed with Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disc wind absorption lines of C IV doublet were shifted to ̃50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which yields a companion-to-black hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disc wind velocity of -400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in particular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain the mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting compact objects with detectable accretion disc wind absorption line features.","keyword":["accretion","accretion discs","black hole physics","stars: luminosity function","mass function","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: individual: GRO J1655-40","X-rays: individual: LMC X-3","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

The technique uses two rest-frame hardness ratios which are optimized for this task, which we designate HR1 (2-4/1-2 keV) and HR2 (4-16/2-4 keV). The selection method exploits the fact that while obscured AGN appear hard in HR2 due to absorption of the intrinsic source flux below ̃4 keV, they appear soft in HR1 due to excess emission originating from scattered source light, thermal emission or host galaxy emission. Such emission is ubiquitous in low-redshift samples. The technique offers a very simple and straightforward way of estimating the fraction of obscured AGN in samples with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in the X-ray band.

The lowest observed flux corresponds to a luminosity of ?  erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This, together with the orbital period of 2.4 h reported in the literature, suggests that the quiescent X-ray luminosity is higher than predicted on the basis of the orbital period-quiescent X-ray luminosity relationship. It is more in line with that expected for a neutron star, although the outburst spectral and timing properties reported in the literature strongly suggest that MAXI J1659-152  harbours a black hole. This conclusion is subject to confirmation of the lowest observed flux as the quiescent flux. The relation between the accretion and ejection mechanisms can be studied using the observed correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities as these evolve over an outburst. We determine the behaviour of MAXI J1659-152  in the radio-X-ray diagram at low X-ray luminosities using the observations reported in this paper and at high X-ray luminosities using values reported in the literature. At high X-ray luminosities, the source lies closer to the sources that follow a correlation index steeper than 0.6-0.7. However, when compared to other sources that follow a steeper correlation index, the X-ray luminosity in MAXI J1659-152  is also lower. The latter can potentially be explained by the high inclination of MAXI J1659-152  if the X-ray emission comes from close to the source and the radio emission is originating in a more extended region. However, it is probable that the source was not in the canonical low-hard state during these radio observations and this may affect the behaviour of the source as well. At intermediate X-ray luminosities, the source makes the transition from the radio underluminous sources in the direction of the relation traced by the 'standard' correlation similar to what has been reported for H 1743-322 in the literature.

Previous observations of this z = 0.44 system showed that, as well as powering the hyperluminous infrared emission of the cluster-central galaxy, the QSO is associated with a double-lobed radio source. However, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between the jets and ionized optical emission suggested that the orientation of the QSO had recently changed. We use a combination of new, multiband Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are no longer powered by the QSO, and estimate their age to be 120-160 Myr. This is in agreement with the ̃70-200 Myr age previously estimated for star formation in the galaxy. Previously unpublished Very Long Baseline Array data reveal a 200 pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely aligned with the current QSO axis and may represent a more recent period of jet activity. These results suggest that the realignment of the QSO, the cessation of jet activity and the onset of rapid star formation may have been caused by a gas-rich galaxy merger. X-ray observations reveal a spiral structure in the intracluster medium (ICM) which suggests that the cluster is in the process of relaxation after a tidal encounter or merger with another system; such a merger could provide a mechanism for transporting a gas-rich galaxy into the cluster core without stripping its cold gas. A Chandra X-ray observation confirms the presence of cavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required to inflate them to be ̃7.7 ×10<SUP>60</SUP> erg. The mechanical power of the jets is sufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided that they are efficiently coupled to the ICM.

In addition, the difference in radial velocity between the brightest cluster galaxies of the two sub-clusters of 144 ± 25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> is small compared to typical collision velocities of several 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A strongly lensed background galaxy at z = 0.873 (which features variable X-ray emission from an active nucleus) provides the main constraint on the mass distribution of the system. We measure M(〈75 kpc) = (5.6 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> for the north-western cluster component and a much less certain estimate of (1.5-3) × 10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> for the south-eastern sub-cluster. These values are in good agreement with our X-ray mass estimates which yield a total mass of MACS J0140.0-0555 of M(〈r<SUB>500</SUB>) ̃ (6.8-9.1) × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>.Although all optical and X-ray properties of MACS J0140.0-0555 are consistent with a well-advanced head-on merger proceeding along an axis close to the plane of the sky, the degeneracy between Hubble flow and peculiar velocity prevents us from obtaining a quantitative constraint on the inclination angle of the merger axis. The lack of pronounced substructure in the cluster gas distribution and the proximity of the two optical cluster cores both in projection and in radial velocity suggest that the merger is observed well after the primary collision and, possibly, after turnaround. A weak-lensing analysis of the mass distribution in MACS J0140.0-0555 has the potential of yielding constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter similar to those obtained for MACS J0025.4-1222, although the smaller projected separation of the two cluster components makes the measurement more challenging.

The ionized iron K-edge of the heavily absorbed component explains most of the seemingly broad line-like features, a well-known spectral characteristic of MCG -6-30-15.

Because the neutron star's direct emission is hidden, its ADC emission is visible. The physical properties of the ADC in X1822-371 have been widely studied, but are still debated in literature. In light of the recent literature and of the results reported in this work we show that the ADC is optically thin. <BR /> Aims: We analyse two Chandra observations and one XMM-Newton observation to study the discrete features in this source and their variation as a function of the orbital phase, deriving constraints on the temperature, density, and location of the plasma responsible for emission lines. <BR /> Methods: The HETGS and XMM/Epic-pn observed X1822-371 for 140 and 50 ks, respectively.

No connection is found between X-ray and emission line luminosities from ground-based data, unlike what is found for brighter AGN. Conversely, a strong correlation emerges when using the HST spectroscopic data, which are extracted on a much smaller aperture.

The sample separates into two populations. The 11 objects belonging to the first class have an equivalent width (EW) of the [O III] emission line measured from HST data EW[O III] ≳ 2 Å and are associated with an X-ray nuclear source; in the second group we find seven galaxies with EW[O III] ≲ 1 Å that generally do not show any emission related to an active nucleus (emission lines, X-ray, or radio sources).

Due to variability, simultaneous X-ray and radio observations are a priori required, but only a comparably small number of YSOs have been studied in this way. Results have been inconclusive due to the even smaller number of YSOs that were simultaneously detected in X-ray and radio observations. <BR /> Aims: We use archival X-ray and radio observations of the Orion nebula cluster (ONC) to significantly enlarge the sample size of known YSOs with both X-ray and radio detections. <BR /> Methods: We study the ONC using multi-epoch non-simultaneous archival Chandra X-ray and NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) single-band radio data. The multiple epochs allow us to reduce the impact of variability by obtaining approximated quiescent fluxes. <BR /> Results: We find that only a small fraction of the X-ray sources (7%) have radio counterparts, even if 60% of the radio sources have X-ray counterparts. YSOs with detections in both bands thus constitute a small minority of the cluster. The radio flux density is typically too low to distinguish thermal and nonthermal radio sources. Only a small fraction of the YSOs with detections in both bands are compatible with the empirical \"Güdel-Benz\" (GB) relation. Most of the sources not compatible with the GB relation are proplyds, and thus likely thermal sources, but only a fraction of the proplyds is detected in both bands, such that the role of these sources is inconclusive. <BR /> Conclusions: While the radio sources appear to be globally unrelated to the X-ray sources, the X-ray dataset clearly is much more sensitive than the radio data. We find tentative evidence that known non-thermal radio sources and saturated X-ray sources are indeed close to the empirical relation, even if skewed to higher radio luminosities, as they are expected to be. Most of the sources that are clearly incompatible with the empirical relation are proplyds that could instead plausibly be thermal radio sources. The newly expanded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array with its significantly enhanced continuum sensitivity is beginning to provide an ideal tool for addressing this issue.

Using a red-clump star method, we estimate an interstellar extinction towards the pulsar of A<SUB>V</SUB> ≈ 2 mag, which is consistent with the absorbing column density derived from X-rays. The respective distance agrees with the dispersion measure distance. We reanalysed the Chandra X-ray data and compared the dereddened upper limits with the unabsorbed X-ray spectrum of the pulsar. We find that regarding its optical-X-ray spectral properties this γ-ray pulsar is not distinct from other pulsars detected in both ranges. However, like the Vela pulsar, it is very inefficient in the optical and X-rays. Among a dozen optical sources overlapping with the pulsar X-ray nebula we find one with V ≈ 26.<SUP>m</SUP>9 and R ≈ 26.<SUP>m</SUP>3, whose colour is slightly bluer than that of the field stars and is consistent with the peculiar colours typical for pulsar nebula features.

However, no general consensus on the origin of this trend has been reached so far. Several works have proposed the decrease of the covering factor of the molecular torus with the luminosity (in the framework of the luminosity-dependent unification models) as a possible explanation for the X-ray Baldwin effect. Using the fraction of obscured sources measured by recent X-ray and infrared (IR) surveys as a proxy of the half-opening angle of the torus and recent Monte Carlo simulations of the X-ray radiation reprocessed by a structure with a spherical-toroidal geometry, we test the hypothesis that the X-ray Baldwin effect is related to the decrease of the half-opening angle of the torus with the luminosity. Simulating the spectra of an unabsorbed population with a luminosity-dependent covering factor of the torus as predicted by recent X-ray surveys, we find that this mechanism is able to explain the observed X-ray Baldwin effect.

Different theories have been proposed to explain the formation of massive stars: two are based on accretion processes (monolithic core accretion and competitive accretion), and another on coalescence of low- and intermediate-mass stars. To distinguish between these theories, it is crucial to establish the distribution, the extinction, and the density of young low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. X-ray observations can penetrate the very obscured cradles of massive stars, directly sampling the distribution of the population of pre-main sequence (PMS) low-mass stars in these regions. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to analyze deep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog, to reveal the distribution of the population and clustering of PMS low-mass stars, and to study their possible role in massive star formation. <BR /> Methods: We studied the distribution of PMS low-mass stars with X-ray emission in Orion as a function of extinction with two different methods: a spatial gridding and a close-neigbors method with cells of ~0.03 × 0.03 pc<SUP>2</SUP>, the typical size of protostellar cores. We derived density maps of the stellar population and calculated cluster stellar densities. <BR /> Results: Consistent with previous studies, we found that PMS low-mass stars cluster toward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium cluster (TC), the Orion hot core (OHC), and the OMC1-S region. We derived PMS low-mass stellar densities of 10<SUP>5</SUP> stars pc<SUP>-3</SUP> in the TC and OMC1-S, and of 10<SUP>6</SUP> stars pc<SUP>-3</SUP> in the OHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive star cradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars. The X-ray observations show for the first time in the TC that low-mass stars with intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most massive star θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori C, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted PMS low-mass stars. This \"envelope-core\" structure is also supported by infrared and optical observations. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are needed in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of low-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high fragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a low-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. Finally, although coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massive stars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolution of the OHC cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gas accretion.","keyword":["stars: formation","stars: low-mass","stars: massive","stars: pre-main sequence","ISM: clouds","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

This led us to investigate the contribution of the intracluster light to the total baryon budget for lower mass systems, but we find that it cannot account for the difference observed. <BR /> Conclusions: The gas mass fraction dependence on total mass observed for groups and clusters could be due to the difficulty of low-mass systems to retain gas inside the inner region (r 〈 r<SUB>2500</SUB>). Because of their shallower potential well, non-thermal processes are more effective in expelling the gas from their central regions outwards. Since the differential gas mass fraction is nearly constant, it provides better constraints for cosmology. Moreover, we find that the gas mass fraction does not depend on redshift at a 2σ level.

The presence of this emission line in a galaxy spectrum is indicative of nuclear activity, although the selection is biased toward low absorbing column densities on narrow-line region or galactic scales. A similar sample of unobscured (type 1 AGN) was collected applying the same analysis to zCOSMOS broad-line objects. This paper presents and compares the optical spectral properties of the two AGN samples. Taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the COSMOS field, the properties of the [Ne v]-selected type 2 AGN were investigated, focusing on their host galaxies, X-ray emission, and optical line-flux ratios. Finally, a previously developed diagnostic, based on the X-ray-to-[Ne v] luminosity ratio, was exploited to search for the more heavily obscured AGN. <BR /> Results: We found that [Ne v]-selected narrow-line AGN have Seyfert 2-like optical spectra, although their emission line ratios are diluted by a star-forming component.

A comparison with other selection techniques at z ~ 1, namely the line-ratio diagnostics and X-ray detections, shows that the detection of the [Ne v] λ3426 line is an effective method for selecting AGN in the optical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but cannot provide a complete census of type 2 AGN by itself.

To understand the origin of this radio emission we performed a detailed multiwavelength study with high-quality proprietary data in the radio and X-ray bands and by means of optical data available in the literature. <BR /> Methods: We observed the cluster with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, the Very Large Array, and the Australia Telescope Compact array at 240 and 610 MHz, 1.28, 1.4, 2.3, 4.8, and 8.4 GHz, and performed a detailed morphological and spectral study of the radio emission associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Furthermore, we observed the cluster with the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories to derive the properties of the intracluster gas. Finally, we made use of literature data to obtain the bidimensional distribution of the galaxies in the cluster. <BR /> Results: The radio emission, associated with the north-eastern nucleus of the dumb-bell BCG, is the result of two components: an active radio galaxy, with jets and lobes, plus aged diffuse emission, which is not refurbished with new electrons at present. Our Chandra data show that the radio active nucleus of the BCG has extended X-ray emission, which we classify as a low-luminosity corona. A residual image of the XMM-Newton brightness distribution shows a spiral-like feature, which we interpret as the signature of gas sloshing. A sub-group is clearly visible in the surface brightness residual map, and this is also supported by the XMM-Newton temperature analysis. The optical bidimensional analysis shows substructure in A 3560. A galaxy clump was detected at the location of the X-ray sub-group, and another group is present south of the cluster core, in the region where the spiral-like feature was detected. The aged part of the radio emission closely follows the spiral pattern of the X-ray residual brightness distribution, while the two active radio lobes are bent in a completely different direction. We conclude that the complex radio emission associated with the cluster BCG is the result of a minor merger event in A 3560. The aged diffuse emission is strongly affected by the sloshing motion in the intracluster gas and most likely bears information on the trajectory of the cluster BCG during the dynamical evolution of the cluster. On the other hand, the bent jets and lobes of the current radio AGN activity may reflect a complex gas velocity field in the innermost cluster regions and/or sloshing-induced oscillations in the motion of the cD galaxy.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: individual: A3560","radio continuum: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

New high-bandwidth and high-resolution data of the RCW 49 field have been obtained to survey the radio emission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of the HII region. <BR /> Methods: Radio observations were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and the CABB correlator of the Australia Telescope Compact Array [ATCA], at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz.

The radio emission closely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and filaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the bridge. The overall flattish spectral index is typically consistent with a free-free emission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in the bridge.

Grating spectra of SSS and novae in outburst that show SSS type spectra display atmospheric absorption lines. Radiation transport atmosphere models can be used to derive physical parameters. Blue-shifted absorption lines suggest that hydrostatic equilibrium is an insufficient assumption, and more sophisticated models are required. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we bypass the complications of spectral models and concentrate on the data in a comparative, qualitative study. We inspect all available X-ray grating SSS spectra to determine systematic, model-independent trends. <BR /> Methods: We collected all grating spectra of conventional SSS like Cal 83 and Cal 87 plus observations of novae during their SSS phase. We used comparative plots of spectra of different systems to find common and different features. The results were interpreted in the context of system parameters obtained from the literature. <BR /> Results: We find two distinct types of SSS spectra that we name SSa and SSe. Their main observational characteristics are either clearly visible absorption lines or emission lines, respectively, while both types contain atmospheric continuum emission. SSa spectra are highly structured with no spectral model currently able to reproduce all details. The emission lines clearly seen in SSe may also be present in SSa, hidden within the forest of complex atmospheric absorption and emission features. This suggests that SSe are in fact obscured SSa systems. Similarities between SSe and SSa with obscured and unobscured AGN, respectively, support this interpretation. We find all known or suspected high-inclination systems to emit permanently in an SSe state. Some sources are found to transition between SSa and SSe states, becoming SSe when fainter. <BR /> Conclusions: SSS spectra are subject to various occultation processes. In persistent SSS spectra such as Cal 87, the accretion disc blocks the central hot source when viewed edge on. In novae during their SSS phase, the accretion disc may have been destroyed during the initial explosion but could have reformed by the time of the SSS phase. In addition, clumpy ejecta may lead to temporary obscuration events. The emission lines stem from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc, its wind or further out in clumpy ejecta, while Thomson scattering allows continuum emission to be visible also during total obscuration of the central hot source.","keyword":["novae","cataclysmic variables","X-rays: binaries","binaries: eclipsing","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

The characteristic amplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of turbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)<SUB>δ,max</SUB> = c M, where c ≃ 0.25 for injection scale of 500 kpc.

Increasing conduction (parametrized via the magnetic suppression f = 10<SUP>-3</SUP> → 1) progressively steepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime, E<SUB>δ</SUB>(k) ∝ k<SUP>-2</SUP>. The slope is only weakly dependent on M. The turbulent Prandtl number defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where P<SUB>t</SUB> ≡ t<SUB>cond</SUB>/t<SUB>turb</SUB> 〈 100, the power spectrum develops a significant decay, i.e. conduction stifles turbulent regeneration.

For strong conductivity (f ≥ 0.1), P<SUB>t</SUB> ~ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than the injection scale, globally damping density perturbations by a factor of 2-4, from large to small scales. The velocity spectrum is instead not much affected by conduction. The f ≥ 0.1 regime should also affect the appearance of X-ray images, in which Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor rolls and filaments are washed out. In a stratified system, perturbations are characterized by a mixture of modes: weak/strong turbulence induces higher isobaric/adiabatic fluctuations, while conduction forces both modes towards the intermediate isothermal regime. We provide a general analytic fit which is applied to new deep Chandra observations of Coma cluster.

We then used unpublished data obtained with XMM-Newton to investigate its nature and emission properties in more detail. <BR /> Results: Features in its optical spectrum place XMMUJ132218.3-164247 at a redshift of z ~ 1, implying that it is a background QSO instead of an ULX. We clearly detected some emission lines typical of a QSO, including OIII lines and a broad Mg II line that indicates that the source is a type I AGN. The X-ray spectrum of the source is well modeled by a simple power-law with absorption slightly in excess to the Galactic value. No emission feature at the energy of the FeKα is present in the data.

We present a series of MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core of a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter space of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. Including conduction has a strong effect on the temperature distribution of the core and the appearance of the cold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front surfaces, preventing conduction directly across them, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The geometry of the field is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be connected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions perpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the front that are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas below the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and temperature jumps may nevertheless be preserved. By modifying the gas density distribution below the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find that the characteristic sharp jumps seen in Chandra observations of cold front clusters do not form. Therefore, the presence of cold fronts in hot clusters is in contradiction with our simulations with full Spitzer conduction. This suggests that the presence of cold fronts in hot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the bulk of the intracluster medium. Finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermal conduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either process in isolation. While still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe in the very central (r ~ 5 kpc) regions of the cool core (where something else is required, such as active galactic nucleus feedback), it reduces significantly the mass of gas that experiences a cooling catastrophe outside those small radii.","keyword":["conduction","galaxies: clusters: general","instabilities","magnetohydrodynamics: MHD","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated and radiation-dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a collisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to peak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a search, using Swift/XRT and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to classes whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM. Our sample includes 19 Type IIn SNe, one Type Ibn SN, and eight hydrogen-poor superluminous SNe (SLSN-I such as SN 2005ap). Two SNe (SN 2006jc and SN 2010jl) have X-ray properties that are roughly consistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in optically thick CSM. However, the X-ray emission from SN 2006jc can also be explained as originating in an optically thin region. Thus, we propose that the optical light curve of SN 2010jl is powered by shock breakout in CSM. We suggest that two other events (SN 2010al and SN 2011ht) were too X-ray bright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock-breakout model. We conclude that the light curves of some, but not all, SNe IIn/Ibn are powered by shock breakout in CSM. For the rest of the SNe in our sample, including all of the SLSN-I events, our X-ray limits are not deep enough and were typically obtained too early (i.e., near the SN maximum light) for definitive conclusions about their nature. Late-time X-ray observations are required in order to further test whether these SNe are indeed embedded in dense CSM. We review the conditions required for a shock breakout in a wind profile. We argue that the timescale, relative to maximum light, for the SN to peak in X-rays is a probe of the column density and the density profile above the shock region. In SNe whose X-ray emission slowly rises, and peaks at late times, the optical light curve is likely powered by the diffusion of shock energy in a dense CSM. We note that if the CSM density profile falls faster than a constant-rate wind-density profile, then X-rays may escape at earlier times than estimated for the wind-profile case. Furthermore, if the CSM has a region in which the density profile is very steep relative to a steady wind-density profile, or if the CSM is neutral, then the radio free-free absorption may be sufficiently low for radio emission to be detected.","keyword":["stars: mass-loss","supernovae: general","supernovae: individual: SN 2006jc SN 2010jl","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

New Chandra observations of two moderately radio-loud and highly optically luminous quasars at z 〉~ 4 are also reported. Our HRLQ sample represents the top ~5% of radio-loud quasars (RLQs) in terms of radio loudness. We found that our HRLQs have an X-ray emission enhancement over HRLQs at lower redshifts (by a typical factor of ≈3), and this effect, after controlling for several factors which may introduce biases, has been solidly estimated to be significant at the 3σ-4σ level. HRLQs at z = 3-4 are also found to have a similar X-ray emission enhancement over z 〈 3 HRLQs, which further supports the robustness of our results. We discuss models for the X-ray enhancement's origin including a fractional contribution from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. No strong correlations are found between the relative X-ray brightness and optical/UV emission-line rest-frame equivalent widths (REWs) for RLQs. However, the line REWs are positively correlated with radio loudness, which suggests that relativistic jets make a negligible contribution to the optical/UV continua of these HRLQs (contrary to the case where the emission lines are diluted by the relativistically boosted continuum). Our HRLQs are generally consistent with the known anti-correlation between radio loudness and X-ray power-law photon index.

It is well known that the fraction of GCs hosting LMXBs is considerably higher in red, metal-rich, GCs than in blue, metal-poor GCs.

The 24 μm emission traces the Balmer filaments almost perfectly but lies a few arcsec within, indicating an origin in interstellar dust heated by the shock. Subsequent decline in the IR behind the shock is presumably due largely to grain destruction through sputtering. The emission drops far more rapidly than current models predict, however, even for a higher proportion of small grains than would be found closer to the Galactic plane. The rapid drop may result in part from a grain density that has always been lower—a relic effect from an earlier epoch when the shock was encountering a lower density—but higher grain destruction rates still seem to be required. Spectra from three positions along the NW filament from the Infrared Spectrometer instrument all show only a featureless continuum, consistent with thermal emission from warm dust.

The lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes Morla the coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a double-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9' long tail confirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows a very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial variation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical bow shock, ram-pressure-dominated pulsar wind nebula.

The infrared line emission is extended and co-spatial with optical Hα+ [N II], far-ultraviolet C IV lines, and soft X-ray emission.

The intracluster medium (ICM) mass profile of each cluster in our sample, also integrated in two dimensions, was derived from a spatially resolved spectral analysis using XMM-Newton and Chandra data.

We estimate an Mn-to-Cr mass ratio of ~0.77, which is strongly suggestive of a large neutron excess in the progenitor star before the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. The observed Ni-to-Fe line flux ratio (~0.03) corresponds to a mass ratio of ~0.06, which is generally consistent with the products of the explosive Si-burning regime in Type Ia explosion models, and rules out contamination from the products of neutron-rich nuclear statistical equilibrium in the shocked ejecta. Together with the previously suggested luminous nature of the explosion, these mass ratios provide strong evidence for a super-solar metallicity in the SN progenitor (~3 Z <SUB>☉</SUB>). Kepler's SN was likely the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf formed in the recent past that must have exploded through a relatively prompt channel.","keyword":["ISM: individual objects: Kepler's supernova remnants","ISM: supernova remnants","X-rays: ISM","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

To find likely ranges for the true late- and early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to either the late- or early-type category using probabilistic arguments and consider the scenario that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an upper bound on the early-type fraction. We calculate most likely ranges for the late- and early-type fractions of ≈60%-80% and ≈20%-40%, respectively. We find no clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type. We also find no change to the fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.","keyword":["gamma-ray burst: general","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

These features are interpreted as due to sloshing of the central gas induced by an off-axis minor merger with a perturber. This scenario is further supported by the presence of a peculiar velocity of the central galaxy IC 1860 and the identification of a possible perturber in the optically disturbed spiral galaxy IC 1859. The identification of the perturber is consistent with the comparison with numerical simulations of sloshing.

However, unlike mini-halos, no particle reacceleration is needed to explain the extended radio emission, which is consistent with aged radio plasma redistributed by the sloshing. There is a strong analogy between the X-ray and optical phenomenology of the IC 1860 group and that of two other groups, NGC 5044 and NGC 5846, showing cold fronts.

This shows that WATs can be produced in clusters that are relatively relaxed on large scales. We explore the interaction between heating and cooling in the central region of the cluster.

In this way, rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear activity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees of AGN activity. We find nuclear X-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies with median X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio of L <SUB>X</SUB> = 4.3 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and L <SUB>bol</SUB>/L <SUB>Edd</SUB> = 6.9 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP>, respectively, consistent with low-luminosity AGN activity. Including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections, we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicators and the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, Hubble type, or bulge size. Strong bars do not favor brighter or more efficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity regime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large-scale features.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: nuclei","galaxies: structure","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

We performed a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis, measuring the electron temperature by modeling the continuum and comparing it to the temperature given by the flux ratio of the He-like and H-like lines of sulfur and argon. Using these results, we find that W49B is overionized in the west, with a gradient of overionization increasing from east to west.

The common location of the cold front with the edge of the radio mini-halo supports the idea that the latter originates from electrons being reaccelerated due to sloshing-induced turbulence.

The NuSTAR data presented here represent one of the first instances of a ULX reliably detected at hard (E 〉 10 keV) X-rays. Circinus ULX5 is variable on long time scales by at least a factor of ~5 in flux, and was caught in a historically bright state during our 2013 observations (0.3-30.0 keV luminosity of 1.6 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). During this epoch, the source displayed a curved 3-10 keV spectrum, broadly similar to other bright ULXs. Although pure thermal models result in a high energy excess in the NuSTAR data, this excess is too weak to be modeled with the disk reflection interpretation previously proposed to explain the 3-10 keV curvature in other ULXs. In addition to flux variability, clear spectral variability is also observed. While in many cases the interpretation of spectral components in ULXs is uncertain, the spectral and temporal properties of all the high quality data sets currently available strongly support a simple disk-corona model reminiscent of that invoked for Galactic binaries, with the accretion disk becoming more prominent as the luminosity increases. However, although the disk temperature and luminosity are well correlated across all time scales currently probed, the observed luminosity follows LvpropT <SUP>1.70 ± 0.17</SUP>, flatter than expected for simple blackbody radiation. The spectral variability displayed here is highly reminiscent of that observed from known Galactic black hole binaries (BHBs) at high luminosities.

However, given the diverse behavior observed from Galactic BHB accretion disks, this mass estimate is still uncertain.

Circinus X-1 is a microquasar, creating relativistic jets that were thought to power the arcminute-scale radio nebula surrounding the source. Instead, this nebula can now be attributed to non-thermal synchrotron emission from the forward shock of the supernova remnant.

The comet was observed 4 times for a total on target time of ̃60 ks between the 17th of October and 16th of November 2010, with two of the visits occurring during the EPOXI close approach on 04 November and 05 November 2010. X-ray emission from 103P was qualitatively similar to that observed for collisionally thin Comets 2P/Encke (Lisse, C.M. et al. [2005]. Astrophys. J. 635, 1329-1347) and 9P/Tempel 1 (Lisse, C.M. et al. [2007]. Icarus 190, 391-405). Emission morphology offset sunward but asymmetrical from the nucleus and emission lines produced by charge exchange between highly stripped C, N, and O solar wind minor ions and coma neutral gas species were found. The comet was very under-luminous in the X-ray at all times, representing the 3rd faintest comet ever detected (L<SUB>X</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.3 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The coma was collisionally thin to the solar wind at all times, allowing solar wind ions to flow into the inner coma and interact with the densest neutral coma gas. Localization of the X-ray emission in the regions of the major rotating gas jets was observed, consistent with the major source of cometary neutral gas species being icy coma dust particles. Variable spectral features due to changing solar wind flux densities and charge states were also seen. Modeling of the Chandra observations from the first three visits using observed gas production rates and ACE solar wind ion fluxes with a charge exchange mechanism for the emission is consistent with the temporal and spectral behavior expected for a slow, hot wind typical of low latitude emission from the solar corona interacting with the comet's neutral coma. The X-ray emission during the 4th visit on 16 November 2010 is similar to the unusual behavior seen for Comet 17P/Holmes in 2007 (Christian, D.J. et al. [2010]. Astrophys. J. Suppl. 187, 447-459) as the solar wind became dominated by a less ionized and faster plasma, more typical of outflow from polar coronal hole regions. We postulate that the overall faintness of the comet seen during all visits is due to the unusually well mixed dust and gas content of this hyperactive comet's coma producing Auger electrons rather than X-rays via charge exchange with the solar wind. An alternative possible explanation for the faintness of the comet's X-ray emission, and its unusual high CV and unusually low CVI emission, is that the impinging solar wind was drastically slowed in the inner coma, below 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, before charge exchanging with cometary neutrals."}]}}

By analogy with processes known to take place on Jupiter, Saturnian X-ray aurorae may be expected to be powered by charge exchange (CX) between energetic ions and the planet's atmospheric neutrals; if the ions are of solar origin, the emission should be brightest during episodes of enhanced solar wind (SW). We have explored this possibility by propagating SW parameters measured near the Earth to Saturn, and triggering X-ray observations at the time SW enhancements were expected to reach the planet. This was done in April-May 2011 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and we report on two observations carried out at the time when a significant SW disturbance reached Saturn, as indicated by Cassini magnetic field, plasma and radio measurements: variability is observed between the two Chandra datasets, but we do not find evidence for X-ray brightening in the auroral regions. The variability can be explained by scattering of solar X-rays in Saturn's atmosphere during an episode of solar X-ray flaring. We conclude that the strength of any CX auroral X-ray emission on Saturn was below Chandra's detectability threshold. By-products of this investigation are stringent upper limits on the X-ray emission of Titan and Enceladus.

The method relies on two non-informative geometrical assumptions: the distributions of total matter or gas are approximately ellipsoidal and co-aligned; they have different, constant axial ratios but share the same degree of triaxiality. Weak and strong lensing probe the features of the total mass distribution in the plane of the sky. X-ray data measure the size and orientation of the gas in the plane of the sky. Comparison with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich amplitude fixes the elongation of the gas along the line of sight. These constraints are deprojected as a result of Bayesian inference.

With the benefit of deep 24 μm observations, our sample of these IR-excess galaxies is larger than previous studies and combined with the deepest X-ray data yield new insights into the population.

While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN fraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread Compton-thick activity in either the sBzK population generally or the IR-excess sBzK subsample. The very hard X-ray signal obtained for the latter in earlier work was most likely contaminated by a few hard X-ray sources now directly detected in deeper X-ray data. The X-ray detection fraction of passive BzK galaxies in our sample is anything higher than that of sBZK galaxies, so there is no evidence for coeval black hole growth and star formation from X-ray analysis of the BzK populations. Because increased AGN activity in the IR-excess population is not indicated by our X-ray analysis, it appears that the bulk of the IR-excess sBzK population are luminous star-forming galaxies whose SFRs are either overestimated at 24 μm, underestimated in the UV, or both.

While PSR J2051-0827 is firmly detected, we can only give upper limits for the X-ray flux of PSR J1600-3053. There are no dedicated X-ray observations available for the other three objects.The MSPs mentioned above, together with most of the MSPs detected by Fermi, are used to put together a sample of 30 gamma-ray MSPs. This sample is used to study the morphology and phase connection of radio and gamma-ray pulse profiles. We show that MSPs with pulsed gamma-ray emission which is phase-aligned with the radio emission present the steepest radio spectra and the largest magnetic fields at the light cylinder among all MSPs. Also, we observe a trend towards very low, or undetectable, radio linear polarization levels. These properties could be attributed to caustic radio emission produced at a range of different altitudes in the magnetosphere. We note that most of these characteristics are also observed in the Crab pulsar, the only other radio pulsar known to exhibit phase-aligned radio and gamma-ray emission.","keyword":["pulsars: general","gamma-rays: general","X-rays: general","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Based on HET optical spectra of [O III], we refine the redshift of IRAS 13349 to be z = 0.108 53.

We develop a geometrical model in which we view the nuclear regions of the QSO along a line of sight that passes through the upper atmosphere of an obscuring torus. This sight line is largely transparent in X-rays since the gas is ionized, but it is completely obscured by dust that blocks a direct view of the UV/optical emission region. In the context of our model, 20 per cent of the intrinsic UV/optical continuum is scattered into our sight line by the far wall of an obscuring torus.

We have investigated the grating spectra of Cyg X-2 from 10 XMM-Newton observations, in search of the missing line. We detect it consistently in nine of these observations, but the line is absent in the remaining one observation or is inconsistent with the detection in others at a ̃4σ confidence level. This absence of the line resembles that seen in the Chandra observations. Similarly, the O VI Kα line is found to disappear occasionally, but not in concert with the variation of the O VII Kα line. All these variations are most likely due to the presence of changing O VII and O VI Kα emission lines of Cyg X-2, which are blurred together with the absorption ones in the X-ray spectra. A re-examination of the Chandra grating data indeed shows evidence for a narrow emission line slightly off the O VI Kα absorption line. We further show that narrow N V emission lines with varying centroids and fluxes are present in far-ultraviolet spectra from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. These results provide new constraints on the accretion around the neutron star and on the X-ray-heating of the stellar companion.

We also uncovered a background subgroup within the range 0.066 ≤ z 〈 0.070. Additionally, ATCA Stokes Q and U data of Abell 3135 were used to obtain rotation measure values along the line of sight to PKS J0334-3900.

A lower limit to the cluster magnetic field was calculated to be 0.09 ± 0.03 μG. From these results, we have shown that different techniques can be combined from the observations of head-tail galaxies to infer information on the cluster environment, showing them to be an important class of objects in next generation all sky surveys.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: individual: A3135","galaxies: general","radio continuum: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

The majority of the clusters in our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last ̃10<SUP>7</SUP> yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington rate, or a power output of {̃ }10^{45} {erg s^{-1}}, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample, we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power, due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion, which could play a significant role in low-power jets.","keyword":["accretion","accretion discs","galaxies: active","galaxies: jets","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

This prediction is borne out by the recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Crain et al., which reproduce observed scaling relations between the X-ray and optical properties of nearby disc galaxies. Such coronae are metal poor, but observations of the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) of local galaxies typically indicate enrichment to near-solar iron abundance, potentially signalling a shortcoming in current models of galaxy formation. We show here that, while the hot CGM of galaxies formed in the simulations is typically metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its X-ray luminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. This bias arises because the soft X-ray emissivity of a typical ̃0.1 keV corona is dominated by collisionally excited metal ions that are synthesized in stars and recycled into the hot CGM. We find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars that form in situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites or external galaxies. The enrichment of the hot CGM therefore proceeds in an `inside-out' fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals are transported from the central galaxy by supernova-driven winds and convection over several Gyr, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient. Whilst metal ions synthesized by stars are necessary to produce the X-ray emissivity that enables the hot CGM of isolated galaxies to be detected with current instrumentation, the electrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. Since our simulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated by the metal-poor gas accreted from the IGM, we infer that the hot CGM observed via X-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellar recycling.","keyword":["galaxies: formation","galaxies: haloes","intergalactic medium","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

In this paper, we compare the population of X-ray point sources (expected to be low-mass X-ray binaries; LMXBs) in UCD candidates, that is, relatively high-luminosity compact systems, with that known to exist in lower mass GCs. Any difference in LMXB populations may then indicate physical differences between GCs and UCDs.

The LMXB content per unit stellar mass is therefore much lower for the UCD candidates, intermediate between that for GCs and for elliptical galaxies. This difference between UCDs and GCs can be explained if UCDs have significantly lower central densities than lower mass GCs, as this will reduce the stellar encounter rate and therefore the production of suitable binary systems.

However, previous studies have shown that `mini-BAL' and narrow absorption line (NAL) outflows have dramatically less X-ray absorption than BALs. Here, we examine X-ray and rest-frame UV spectra of eight mini-BAL quasars with outflow speeds in the range 0.1-0.2c to test the hypothesis that these extreme speeds require a strong shield.

We argue that the outflow ionizations are kept moderate, instead, by high gas densities in small clouds.

This evolutionary model is supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron stars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may temporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems. Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This not only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales.","keyword":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

We confirm the presence of an H ii region next to the supernova remnant and coincident with molecular emission. A potential region of star formation is also identified. We identify several radio and X-ray sources in the surroundings.

We used Chandra data, when available, to identify point sources. In the optical, we applied a Serna & Gerbal (SG) analysis to clusters with at least 15 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts available in the cluster range. We discuss the substructure detection efficiencies of both methods. <BR /> Results: XMM-Newton data were available for 32 clusters, for which we derive the X-ray luminosity and a global X-ray temperature for 25 of them. For 23 clusters we were able to fit the X-ray emissivity with a β-model and subtract it to detect substructures in the X-ray gas. A dynamical analysis based on the SG method was applied to the clusters having at least 15 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts in the cluster range: 18 X-ray clusters and 11 clusters with no X-ray data. The choice of a minimum number of 15 redshifts implies that only major substructures will be detected. Ten substructures were detected both in X-rays and by the SG method. Most of the substructures detected both in X-rays and with the SG method are probably at their first cluster pericentre approach and are relatively recent infalls. We also find hints of a decreasing X-ray gas density profile core radius with redshift. <BR /> Conclusions: The percentage of mass included in substructures was found to be roughly constant with redshift values of 5-15%, in agreement both with the general CDM framework and with the results of numerical simulations.

The flux level and energy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. The monthly light curve above 100 GeV shows a hint of variability at the 3.6σ level. In the Fermi-LAT band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. The optical light curve is also variable and shows a clear correlation with the γ-ray flux above 100 MeV. In radio, three compact components are resolved in the innermost part of the jet. One of these components shows a similar trend as the Fermi-LAT and KVA light curves. The γ-ray spectra measured simultaneously with MAGIC and Fermi-LAT from 100 MeV to 650 GeV can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with a subexponential cutoff for the two observation campaigns. A single-zone synchrotron-self-Compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-law with an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband spectral energy distribution and the multifrequency behavior of the source. However, this model suggests an untypical low bulk-Lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight than the parsec-scale radio jet.","keyword":["galaxies: active","gamma rays: galaxies","galaxies: jets","galaxies: individual: NGC 1275","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Many other X-ray sources exhibit warm absorption features, and they all show periodic dipping behavior at the same time. Recently, a dipping periodicity has also been determined for GX 13+1 using long-term X-ray folded light-curves, leading to a clear identification of one of such periodic dips in an archival Chandra observation. <BR /> Aims: We give the first spectral characterization of the periodic dip of GX 13+1 found in this archival Chandra observation performed in 2010. <BR /> Methods: We used Chandra/HETGS data (1.0-10 keV band) and contemporaneous RXTE/PCA data (3.5-25 keV) to analyze the broad-band X-ray spectrum. We adopted different spectral models to describe the continuum emission and used the XSTAR-derived warm absorber component to constrain the highly ionized absorption features. <BR /> Results: The 1.0-25 keV continuum emission is consistent with a model of soft accretion-disk emission and an optically thick, harder Comptonized component. The dip event, lasting ~450 s, is spectrally resolved with an increase in the column density of the neutral absorber, while we do not find significant variations in the column density and ionization parameter of the warm absorber with respect to the out-of-dip spectrum. <BR /> Conclusions: We argue that the very low dipping duty-cycle with respect to other sources of the same class can be ascribed to its long orbital period and the mostly neutral bulge that is relatively small compared with the dimensions of the outer disk radius.

Using magnetised, partially ionised hydrogen atmosphere models in X-ray spectral fits, we found that the thermal component can come from the entire surface of the cooling neutron star with a temperature of 36<SUP>+8</SUP><SUB>-6</SUB> eV, making it one of the coldest among cooling neutron stars known. The surface temperature agrees with the standard neutron star cooling scenario. The optical upper limit does not put any additional constraints on the thermal component, however it does imply a strong spectral break for the nonthermal component between the optical and X-rays as is observed in other middle-aged pulsars.

Gum 31 is a prominent, but still rather poorly studied H ii region around the stellar cluster NGC 3324 at the northwestern periphery of the Carina nebula complex. <BR /> Aims: Our aim was to reveal and characterize the young stellar population in Gum 31. An X-ray survey is the only efficient way to identify young stars in this region with extremely high galactic field-star contamination that can avoid the strong biases of infrared excess selected samples of disk-bearing young stars. <BR /> Methods: We used the Chandra observatory to perform a deep (70 ks) X-ray observation of the Gum 31 region and detected 679 X-ray point sources. This extends and complements the X-ray survey of the central Carina nebula regions performed in the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP). Using deep near-infrared images from our recent VISTA survey of the Carina nebula complex, our comprehensive Spitzer point-source catalog, and optical archive data, we identify counterparts for 75% of these X-ray sources. <BR /> Results: The spatial distribution of the X-ray selected young stars shows two major concentrations, the central cluster NGC 3324 and a partly embedded cluster in the southern rim of the H ii region. However, these two prominent clusters contain only about 30% of the X-ray selected population, whereas the majority (~70%) of X-ray sources constitute a rather homogeneously distributed population of young stars. Our color-magnitude diagram analysis suggests ages of ~1-2 Myr for the two clusters, whereas the distributed population shows a wider age range up to ~10 Myr. We also identify previously unknown companions to two of the three O-type members of NGC 3324 and detect diffuse X-ray emission in two parts of the region. <BR /> Conclusions: An extrapolation based on the observed X-ray luminosity function suggests that the observed region contains about 4000 young stars in total (down to 0.1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>). This shows that the Gum 31 area contains a substantial fraction of the total stellar population in the CNC. The distributed population of young stars in the Gum 31 region is probably a part or extension of the widely distributed population of ~1-10 Myr old stars, that was identified in the CCCP area. This implies that the global stellar configuration of the Carina nebula complex is a very extended stellar association, in which the (optically prominent) clusters contain only a minority of the stellar population.The Chandra data described in this paper have been obtained in the open time project with Sequence Number 200767 and ObsID 13613 (PI: T.

Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. <BR /> Methods: We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South. <BR /> Results: For the ~350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence (B 〉 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, N<SUB>H</SUB>, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. <BR /> Conclusions: Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk.

We use wide (several 100 AU) binary systems in which one of the stellar components is known to have an exoplanet, while the second stellar component does not have a detected planet and therefore acts as a negative control. We use the stellar coronal X-ray emission as an observational proxy for magnetic activity and analyze observations performed with Chandra and XMM-Newton. <BR /> Results: We find that in two systems for which strong tidal interaction can be expected the planet-hosting primary displays a much higher magnetic activity level than the planet-free secondary. In three systems for which weaker tidal interaction can be expected the activity levels of the two stellar components agree with each other. <BR /> Conclusions: Our observations indicate that the presence of Hot Jupiters may inhibit the spin-down of host stars with thick outer convective layers.

Additional photometric redshifts are computed with a dedicated follow-up program with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and a cross-correlation with the SDSS. In addition, we also blindly search for the Hydrogen-like and He-like iron K<SUB>α</SUB> emission line complex in the X-ray spectrum. We detect the iron emission lines in 35% of the sample, and hence obtain a robust measure of the X-ray redshift z<SUB>X</SUB> with typical rms error 1-5%. We use z<SUB>X</SUB> whenever the optical redshift is not available. Finally, for all the sources with measured redshift, background-subtracted spectra are fitted with a single-temperature mekal model to measure global temperature, X-ray luminosity and iron abundance of the ICM. We perform extensive spectral simulations to accounts for fitting bias, and to assess the robustness of our results. We derive a criterion to select reliable best-fit models and an empirical formula to account for fitting bias. The bias-corrected values are then used to investigate the scaling properties of the X-ray observables. <BR /> Results: Overall, we are able to characterize the ICM of 46 sources with redshifts (64% of the sample). The sample is mostly constituted by clusters with temperatures between 3 and 10 keV, plus 14 low-mass clusters and groups with temperatures below 3 keV. The redshift distribution peaks around z ~ 0.25 and extends up to z ~ 1, with 60% of the sample at 0.1 〈 z 〈 0.4. We derive the luminosity-temperature relation for these 46 sources, finding good agreement with previous studies. <BR /> Conclusions: Thanks to the good X-ray spectral quality and the low background of Swift/XRT, we are able to measure ICM temperatures and X-ray luminosities for the 46 sources with redshifts. Once redshifts are available for the remaining 26 sources, this sample will constitute a well-characterized, flux-limited catalog of clusters distributed over a broad redshift range (0.1 ≤ z ≤ 1.0) providing a statistically complete view of the cluster population with a selection function that allows a proper treatment of any measurement bias. The quality of the SWXCS sample is comparable to other samples available in the literature and obtained with much larger X-ray telescopes. Our results have interesting implications for the design of future X-ray survey telescopes, characterized by good-quality PSF over the entire field of view and low background.Tables 1 and 2 and Appendix A are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201322821/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>Catalog and data products of SWXCS, constantly updated, are made available to the public through the websites <A href=\"http://www.arcetri.astro.it/SWXCS/\">http://www.arcetri.astro.it/SWXCS/</A> and <A href=\"http://swxcs.ustc.edu.cn/\">http://swxcs.ustc.edu.cn/</A>","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: high-redshift","cosmology: observations","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","intergalactic medium","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"]}]}}

The low obscuration and proximity of the Carina nebula make it an ideal place to study the ongoing star formation process and impact of massive stars on low-mass stars in their surroundings. <BR /> Aims: To investigate this process, we generated a new catalog of the pre-main-sequence stars in the Carina west (CrW) region and studied their nature and spatial distribution. We also determined various parameters (reddening, reddening law, age, mass), which are used further to estimate the initial mass function and K-band luminosity function for the region under study. <BR /> Methods: We obtained deep UBVRI Hα photometric data of the field situated to the west of the main Carina nebula and centered on WR 22. Medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of a subsample of X-ray selected objects along with archival data sets from Chandra, XMM-Newton and 2MASS surveys were used for the present study. Different sets of color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are used to determine reddening for the region and to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) and estimate their age and mass. <BR /> Results: Our spectroscopic results indicate that the majority of the X-ray sources are late spectral type stars. The region shows a large amount of differential reddening with minimum and maximum values of E(B - V) as 0.25 and 1.1 mag, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the total-to-selective absorption ratio R<SUB>V</SUB> is ~3.7 ± 0.1, suggesting an abnormal grain size in the observed region. We identified 467 YSOs and studied their characteristics. The ages and masses of the 241 optically identified YSOs range from ~0.1 to 10 Myr and ~0.3 to 4.8 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, respectively. However, the majority of them are younger than 1 Myr and have masses below 2 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The high mass star WR 22 does not seem to have contributed to the formation of YSOs in the CrW region.

The K-band luminosity function slope (α) is also estimated as 0.31 ± 0.01. We also performed minimum spanning tree analysis of the YSOs in this region, which reveals that there are at least ten YSO cores associated with the molecular cloud, and that leads to an average core radius of 0.43 pc and a median branch length of 0.28 pc.Full Table 3 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/567/A109\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/567/A109</A>","keyword":["stars: massive","stars: individual: WR 22","stars: luminosity function","mass function","stars: pre-main sequence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detected from a r ~ 200 pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (CND), from the 2.6 kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3 kpc starburst (SB) ring. Most of the emission in HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, and CS stems from the CND. Molecular line ratios show dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the CND that are correlated with the UV/X-ray illumination by the active galactic nucleus (AGN), betraying ongoing feedback.

Variability is a general property of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The way in which these changes occur at X-rays is not yet clearly understood. In the particular case of low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER) nuclei, variations on the timescales from months to years have been found for some objects, but the main driver of these changes is still debated. <BR /> Aims: The main purpose of this work is to investigate the X-ray variability in LINERs, including the main driver of these variations, and to search for possible differences between type 1 and 2 objects. <BR /> Methods: We examined the 18 LINERs in the Palomar sample with data retrieved from the Chandra and/or XMM-Newton archives that correspond to observations gathered at different epochs. All the spectra for the same object were fitted simultaneously to study long-term variations. The nature of the variability patterns were studied by allowing different parameters to vary during the spectral fit. Whenever possible, short-term variations from the analysis of the light curves and long-term UV variability were studied. <BR /> Results: Short-term variations are not reported in X-rays. Three LINERs are classified as non-AGN candidates in X-rays, all of them are Compton-thick candidates; none of them show variations at these frequencies, and two of them vary in the UV. Long-term X-ray variations were analyzed in 12 out of 15 AGN candidates; about half of them showed variability (7 out of the 12). At UV frequencies, most of the AGN candidates with available data are variable (five out of six). Thus, 13 AGN candidates are analyzed at UV and/or X-rays, ten of which are variable at least in one energy band. None of the three objects that do not vary in X-rays have available UV data. This means that variability on long-timescales is very common in LINERs. These X-ray variations are mainly driven by changes in the nuclear power, while changes in absorptions are found only for NGC 1052. We do not find any difference between type 1 and 2 LINERs, neither in the number of variable cases (three out of five type 1 and four out of seven type 2 LINERs), nor in the nature of the variability pattern. We find indications of an anticorrelation between the slope of the power law, Γ, and the Eddington ratio. <BR /> Conclusions: LINERs are definitely variable sources irrespective of whether they are classified as optical type 1 or 2. Their BH masses, accretion rates, and variability timescales place them in the same plane as more powerful AGN at X-rays. However, our results suggest that the accretion mechanism in LINERs may be different. UV variations of some type 2 LINERs were found, this could support the hypothesis of a torus that disappears at low luminosities.Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424140/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>","keyword":["galaxies: active","X-rays: galaxies","ultraviolet: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

Our study reveals that the four detected SNRs all feature center-filled X-ray morphologies and that the observed emission from these sources is thermal in all cases.

Our ASCA analysis of G311.5-0.3 reveals for the first time X-ray emission from this SNR: the X-ray emission is center-filled within the radio and infrared shells and thermal in nature (kT ~ 0.98 keV), thus motivating its classification as an MM SNR. We find considerable spectral variations in the properties associated with the plasmas of the other X-ray-detected SNRs, such as a possible overabundance of magnesium in the plasma of Kes 17. Our new results also include the first detailed spatially resolved spectroscopic study of CTB 37A using Chandra as well as a spectroscopic study of the discrete X-ray source CXOU J171428.5-383601, which may be a neutron star associated with CTB 37A.

This is contrary to the expectation that the temperature should rise toward the center for a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. A hotter thermal component of ~1 keV inside 3'' (~150 pc) is revealed using a two-component thermal model, with the cooler ~0.3 keV thermal component dominating the spectra.

In this work, taking [O IV] 25.89 μm emission line as an isotropic indicator of AGNs' intrinsic luminosity, we compare the intrinsic corona X-ray emission between Seyfert 1 and Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies, which are viewed at different inclinations according to the unification scheme.

Known radio-loud sources are excluded. We fit the X-ray spectra to obtain the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV continuum luminosities. We find that Seyfert 1 galaxies are intrinsically brighter in intrinsic 2-10 keV emission by a factor of 2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4} (2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.3} in Swift Burst Alert Telescope 14-195 keV emission), compared with Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies. The Seyfert 1 and Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies follow a statistically identical correlation between the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and the 14-195 keV luminosity, indicating that our absorption correction to the 2-10 keV flux is sufficient. The difference in X-ray emission between the two populations is thus unlikely to be due to X-ray absorption, and instead implies an intrinsic anisotropy in the corona X-ray emission. This striking anisotropy of X-ray emission can be explained by a bipolar outflowing corona with a bulk velocity of ~0.3-0.5c. This would provide a natural link between the so-called coronae and weak jets in these systems.

Shocked gas previously produced by the system at earlier orbital phases is suggested to produce the faint residual X-ray emission seen when the emission near the apex is completely blocked by the primary wind. The brighter phase is probably caused by the re-appearance of the WWC plasma, whose emissivity significantly declined during the occultation.

About 14% are too faint to be resolved in the rest-frame UV morphology due to high dust extinction. We estimate dust extinction from spectral energy distributions. We find that dust extinction is generally correlated with Hα luminosity and stellar mass. Our results suggest that Hα ELGs are representative of star-forming galaxies. Applying extinction corrections to individual objects, we examine the intrinsic Hα luminosity function (LF) at z = 2.24, obtaining a best-fit Schechter function characterized by a faint-end slope of α = - 1.3. This is shallower than the typical slope of α ~= -1.6 in previous works based on constant extinction correction. We demonstrate that this difference is mainly due to the different extinction corrections. The proper extinction correction is thus the key to recovering the intrinsic LF as the extinction globally increases with Hα luminosity. Moreover, we find that our Hα LF mirrors the stellar mass function of star-forming galaxies at the same cosmic epoch.

We suggest that the data can be explained in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field objects are radio-overluminous and X-ray-underluminous, possibly because of a population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously replenished by low-energy reconnection events.","keyword":["brown dwarfs","radio continuum: stars","stars: activity","stars: coronae","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

In this paper, we analyze the X-ray activity-rotation relation in 38 UCDs. Our sample represents the largest catalog of X-ray active UCDs to date, including seven new and four previously unpublished Chandra observations presented in a companion paper. We identify a substantial number of rapidly rotating UCDs with X-ray activity extending two orders of magnitude below the expected saturation level and measure a \"supersaturation\"-type anticorrelation between rotation and X-ray activity. The scatter in UCD X-ray activity at a fixed rotation is ~3 times larger than that in earlier-type stars. We discuss several mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the data, including centrifugal stripping of the corona, and find them to be inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, we suggest that an additional parameter correlated with both X-ray activity and rotation is responsible for the observed effects. Building on the results of Zeeman-Doppler imaging of UCD magnetic fields and our companion study of radio/X-ray flux ratios, we argue that this parameter is the magnetic field topology, and that the large scatter in UCD X-ray fluxes reflects the presence of two dynamo modes that produce distinct topologies.","keyword":["magnetic fields","stars: activity","stars: low-mass","stars: rotation","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

Here we present a study of the X-ray scattered halo around IGR J17544-2619, which is one of the so-called supergiant fast X-ray transients.

The 10 year light curve of Cen A is presented, and hardness ratios confirm that the spectral shape changes very little despite the luminosity varying by a factor of a few. Primarily, we establish the presence of a reflection component in the average spectrum by demonstrating an excess between 20 and 60 keV, from extending the spectral shape observed at low energy to the SPI regime. The excess in Chandra HETGS and INTEGRAL SPI data is well described by reflection of the dominant power-law spectrum from a neutral, optically thick atmosphere.

Using simulated spectra, we demonstrate that a high energy cutoff reproduces the observed spectral properties of Cen A more readily than a simple power law.

An acceptable model was found for the XMM-Newton data fitting the EPIC-PN and RGS spectra simultaneously; later, this model was successfully applied to the contemporary Chandra high-resolution data. The model consists of a continuum emission component (power law + blackbody) absorbed by four ionized components (warm absorbers), and 10 narrow emission lines. Three absorbing components are warm, producing features only in the soft X-ray band. The fourth ionization component produces Fe XXV and Fe XXVI in the hard-energy band. We study the time response of the absorbing components to the well-detected changes in the X-ray luminosity of this source and find that the two components with the lower ionization state show clear opacity changes consistent with gas close to photoionization equilibrium. These changes are supported by the models and by differences in the spectral features among the nine observations. On the other hand, the two components with higher ionization state do not seem to respond to continuum variations.

We also measure spatially resolved spectra, showing that the spectrum of the PWN softens away from the central pulsar B1509-58, and that there exists a roughly sinusoidal variation of spectral hardness in the azimuthal direction. We discuss the results using particle flow models. We find non-monotonic structure in the variation with distance of spectral hardness within 50'' of the pulsar moving in the jet direction, which may imply particle and magnetic-field compression by magnetic hoop stress as previously suggested for this source.

Ignoring calibration uncertainty can cause bias in the estimation of source model parameters and can lead to underestimation of the variance of these estimates. We previously introduced a pragmatic Bayesian method to address this problem. The method is \"pragmatic\" in that it introduced an ad hoc technique that simplified computation by neglecting the potential information in the data for narrowing the uncertainty for the calibration product. Following that work, we use a principal component analysis to efficiently represent the uncertainty of the effective area of an X-ray (or γ-ray) telescope. Here, however, we leverage this representation to enable a principled, fully Bayesian method that coherently accounts for the calibration uncertainty in high-energy spectral analysis. In this setting, the method is compared with standard analysis techniques and the pragmatic Bayesian method. The advantage of the fully Bayesian method is that it allows the data to provide information not only for estimation of the source parameters but also for the calibration product—here the effective area, conditional on the adopted spectral model. In this way, it can yield more accurate and efficient estimates of the source parameters along with valid estimates of their uncertainty.

Radial profiles of Chandra and XMM measurements of electron density and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differences in hydrostatic masses inferred from X-ray observations arise from differences in gas-temperature measurements. Encouragingly, gas temperatures measured in clusters by XMM and Chandra are consistent with one another at ~100-200 kpc radii, but XMM temperatures systematically decline relative to Chandra temperatures at larger radii.

During most of the orbit, the 15-25 keV emission varied similarly to the 2-10 keV emission, indicating an origin in the hard energy tail of the kT ~ 4 keV wind-wind collision (WWC) plasma. However, the 15-25 keV emission declined only by a factor of three around periastron when the 2-10 keV emission dropped by two orders of magnitude due probably to an eclipse of the WWC plasma.

To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess observationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of H II regions (~10-100 pc). In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several stellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 H II regions (with ages ~3-10 Myr) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, respectively. Using optical, infrared, radio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized gas, and the hot X-ray-emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have comparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The hot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures are one to two orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from the H II shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational work should be done on very young H II regions to test whether direct radiation pressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.","keyword":["galaxies: star clusters: general","H II regions","stars: formation","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

Utilizing in particular the MYTorus model, we find that the data are consistent with reprocessing by a distant, neutral torus that is marginally Compton-thick ( N <SUB>H</SUB> ~10<SUP>24</SUP>cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) and out of the line of sight. However, we do not find compelling evidence of a relativistically broadened Fe K emission line, which is often expected from type 1 active galactic nuclei. This is consistent with some, although not all, previous studies of MCG +8-11-11. A well-measured edge is identified by the HETG near 0.5 keV, indicating neutral absorption in the line of sight that is consistent with galactic absorption; however, the absorption may be partially intrinsic to the source. The HETG data are consistent with the presence of a soft excess, a feature that may be missed by considering the Suzaku data alone.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: individual: MCG+8-11-11","galaxies: Seyfert","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

As the winds are radiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations with the bolometric luminosity.

No relation is found between other X-ray properties (plasma temperature, absorption) and stellar or magnetic parameters, contrary to expectations (e.g., higher temperature for stronger mass-loss rate). This suggests that the main driver for the plasma properties is different from the main determinant of the X-ray luminosity.

We therefore find evidence for a spectral transition at L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>Edd</SUB> ̃ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, where the X-ray spectral softening observed during the outburst decline turns into hardening as the source goes to quiescence.

In contrast, AGN in red quiescent hosts become increasingly important as a fraction of the total population towards low Eddington ratios. At higher redshift, z 〉 0.6, such differences are significant at the 2σ level only for sources with Eddington ratios ≳ 10<SUP>- 3</SUP>. These findings are consistent with scenarios in which diverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. We compare these results with the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytic model for the cosmological evolution of AGN and galaxies. This model postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first is linked to star formation events and the second takes place in passive galaxies. GALFORM predicts that a substantial fraction of the black hole growth at z 〈 1 is associated with quiescent galaxies, in apparent conflict with the observations. Relaxing the strong assumption of the model that passive AGN hosts have zero star formation rate could bring those predictions in better agreement with the data.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: Seyfert","X-rays: diffuse background","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

At very low luminosities, the spectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases and then, above a particular luminosity, softening again. At a given flux level, the scatter in hardness ratio is not very large, meaning that the spectral shape is largely determined by the luminosity. The spectra were therefore summed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models.

Mid-IR-selected AGN are less centrally concentrated overall. Optical variables have a similar distribution to normal galaxies in the inner regions, then become somewhat less centrally concentrated farther from the cluster centre. The host galaxies of AGN reveal a different colour distribution than normal galaxies, with many AGN hosts displaying galaxy colours in the `green valley' between the red sequence and blue star-forming normal galaxies. This result is similar to those found in field galaxy studies. The colour distribution of AGN hosts is more pronounced in disturbed clusters where minor mergers, galaxy harassment, and interactions with cluster substructure may continue to prompt star formation in the hosts. Among normal galaxies, we find that galaxy colours become generally bluer with increasing cluster radius, as is expected. However, we find no relationship between host galaxy colour and cluster radius among AGN hosts, which may indicate that processes related to the accreting supermassive black hole have a greater impact on the star-forming properties of the host galaxy than does the intracluster medium and/or local galaxy environment.","keyword":["galaxies: active","galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: statistics","infrared: galaxies","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

The loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy is balanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering.

The corrections related to this effect are then strongly important in the study of the spectral properties. Tests of these calibrations are more suitable in sources which spectra are characterized by a large number of discrete features. Therefore, in this work, we carried out a spectral analysis of the accreting neutron star GX 13+1, which is a dipping source with several narrow absorption lines and a broad emission line in its spectrum. We tested two different correction approaches on an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation taken in Timing mode: the standard rate-dependent charge transfer inefficiency (RDCTI or epfast) and the new, rate-dependent pulse height amplitude (RDPHA) corrections. We found that, in general, the two corrections marginally affect the properties of the overall broad-band continuum, while hints of differences in the broad emission line spectral shape are seen. On the other hand, they are dramatically important for the centroid energy of the absorption lines. In particular, the RDPHA corrections provide a better estimate of the spectral properties of these features than the RDCTI corrections. Indeed the discrete features observed in the data, applying the former method, are physically more consistent with those already found in other Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of GX 13+1.","keyword":["accretion","accretion discs","line: identification","stars: neutron","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: galaxies","X-rays: individual: (GX 13+1)","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"]}]}}

The detected emission in the so-called blue bump is attributed mainly to late-type nitrogen WRs (WNL), ranging from a few dozens to several hundreds of stars per region. Our estimated WNL/(WNL+O) ratio is comparable to reported empirical relations once the extinction-corrected emission is further corrected by the presence of dust grains inside the nebula that absorb a non-negligible fraction of UV photons. Comparisons of observables with stellar population models show disagreement by factors larger than 2-3. However, if the effects of interacting binaries and/or photon leakage are taken into account, observations and predictions tend to converge. We estimate the binary fraction of the H II regions hosting WRs to be significant in order to recover the observed X-ray flux, hence proving that the binary channel can be critical when predicting observables. We also explore the connection of the environment with the current hypothesis that WRs can be progenitors to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Galaxy interactions, which can trigger strong episodes of star formation in the central regions, may be a plausible environment where WRs may act as progenitors of GRBs.

Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations of cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations. Various sources of energy capable of compensating for these cooling losses have been proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes in the central galaxies, through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma. Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is transferred to the ICM remains open. Here we present a plausible solution to this question based on deep X-ray data and a new data analysis method that enable us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate from the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally at each radius--it may therefore be the key element in resolving the gas cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in the atmospheres of X-ray-emitting, gas-rich systems on scales from galaxy clusters to groups and elliptical galaxies.","keyword":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

This value, together with high column density of CIV ion, place strong constraints on the photoionisation model. We used two photoionisation codes to derive the hydrogen number density at the cloud illuminated surface. By estimating bolometric luminosity of HS 1603 + 3820 using the typical formula for quasars, we calculated the distance to A1. We could find one photoionization solution, by assuming either a constant density cloud (which was modelled using CLOUDY), or a stratified cloud (which was modelled using TITAN), as well as the solar abundances. This model explained both the ionic column density of CIV and the high CIV to HI ratio. The location of A1 is 0.1 pc, and it is situated even closer to the nucleus than the possible location of the Broad Line Region in this object.

From the theoretical point of view, these oscillations may be modeled by the process of accretion disk instability, driven by the dominant radiation pressure and enhanced heating of the plasma. Although the mean accretion rate in this source is probably below the Eddington limit, the oscillations will still have large amplitudes. As the observations show, the source can exhibit strong wind outflow during the soft state.

We accounted for a variable wind outflow from the disk surface. We examined the data archive from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites to find the observed limitations on the wind physical properties, such as its velocity and ionization state. We also investigated the long-term evolution of this source, which lasted over about 600 days of observations, using the data collected by the Swift and RXTE satellites.

In this work we present the details of our campaign and the data obtained by all the observatories.

Robust X-ray temperature measurements of the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters require an accurate energy-dependent effective area calibration. Since the hot gas X-ray emission of galaxy clusters does not vary on relevant timescales, they are excellent cross-calibration targets. Moreover, cosmological constraints from clusters rely on accurate gravitational mass estimates, which in X-rays strongly depend on cluster gas temperature measurements. Therefore, systematic calibration differences may result in biased, instrument-dependent cosmological constraints. This is of special interest in light of the tension between the Planck results of the primary temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-plus-X-ray cluster-count analyses. <BR /> Aims: We quantify in detail the systematics and uncertainties of the cross-calibration of the effective area between five X-ray instruments, EPIC-MOS1/MOS2/PN onboard XMM-Newton and ACIS-I/S onboard Chandra, and the influence on temperature measurements. Furthermore, we assess the impact of the cross-calibration uncertainties on cosmology. <BR /> Methods: Using the HIFLUGCS sample, consisting of the 64 X-ray brightest galaxy clusters, we constrain the ICM temperatures through spectral fitting in the same, mostly isothermal regions and compare the different instruments. We use the stacked residual ratio method to evaluate the cross-calibration uncertainties between the instruments as a function of energy. Our work is an extension to a previous one using X-ray clusters by the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC) and is carried out in the context of IACHEC. <BR /> Results: Performing spectral fitting in the full energy band, (0.7-7) keV, as is typical of the analysis of cluster spectra, we find that best-fit temperatures determined with XMM-Newton/EPIC are significantly lower than Chandra/ACIS temperatures. This confirms the previous IACHEC results obtained with older calibrations with high precision. The difference increases with temperature, and we quantify this dependence with a fitting formula. For instance, at a cluster temperature of 10 keV, EPIC temperatures are on average 23% lower than ACIS temperatures. We also find systematic differences between the three XMM-Newton/EPIC instruments, with the PN detector typically estimating the lowest temperatures. Testing the cross-calibration of the energy-dependence of the effective areas in the soft and hard energy bands, (0.7-2) keV and (2-7) keV, respectively, we confirm the previously indicated relatively good agreement between all instruments in the hard and the systematic differences in the soft band. We provide scaling relations to convert between the different instruments based on the effective area, gas temperature, and hydrostatic mass. We demonstrate that effects like multitemperature structure and different relative sensitivities of the instruments at certain energy bands cannot explain the observed differences. We conclude that using XMM-Newton/EPIC instead of Chandra/ACIS to derive full energy band temperature profiles for cluster mass determination results in an 8% shift toward lower Ω<SUB>M</SUB> values and 〈1% change of σ<SUB>8</SUB> values in a cosmological analysis of a complete sample of galaxy clusters.

An explanation of the fact that D3-43-S3 is detected through weak lensing (only marginally, at the ~3σ level) but not in X-rays could be that the two substructures are just beginning to merge more or less along the line of sight. We also show that D3-6 and D3-43-S3 have similar global galaxy luminosity functions, stellar mass functions, and star formation rate (SFR) distributions. The only differences are that D3-6 exhibits a lack of faint early-type galaxies, a deficit of extremely high stellar mass galaxies compared to D3-43-S3, and an excess of very high SFR galaxies. <BR /> Conclusions: This study shows the power of techniques based on photometric redshifts to detect low to moderately massive structures, even at z ~ 0.75.

We find that the H/He ratios are not well reproduced by this simple isobaric cooling flow model and show that while H-like line fluxes can be accurately predicted, fluxes of lower-Z He-like lines are significantly underestimated. This discrepancy suggests that an extra heating mechanism plays an important role at the base of the accretion column, where cooler ions form. We thus explored more complex cooling models, including the change of gravitational potential with height in the accretion column and a magnetic dipole geometry. None of these modifications to the standard cooling flow model are able to reproduce the observed line ratios. While a cooling flow model with subsolar (0.1 ☉) abundances is able to reproduce the line ratios by reducing the cooling rate at temperatures lower than ~10<SUP>7.3</SUP> K, the predicted line-to-continuum ratios are much lower than observed. We discuss and discard mechanisms, such as photoionization, departures from constant pressure, resonant scattering, different electron-ion temperatures, and Compton cooling. Thermal conduction transfers energy from the region above 10<SUP>7</SUP> K, where the H-like lines are mostly formed, to the cooler regions where the He-like ions of the lower-Z elements are formed, hence in principle it could help resolve the problem. However, simple models indicate that the energy is deposited below 10<SUP>6</SUP> K, which is too cool to increase the emission of the He-like lines we observe. We conclude that some other effect, such as thermally unstable cooling, modifies the temperature distribution.","keyword":["novae","cataclysmic variables","radiation mechanisms: general","X-rays: individuals: EX Hydrae","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}]}}

To study time evolution, we divided each light curve into short time-segments and computed power spectra.

We present the analysis of the high resolution X-ray spectra collected with XMM-Newton and Chandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate the variability of both the obscurer and classical warm absorber. The time separation between these X-ray observations range from two days to eight months. On these timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and in covering fraction. This is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. The most significant variation occurred in September 2013 when the source brightened for two weeks. A higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lower obscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shape during the flare. We suggest that a geometrical change of the soft X-ray source behind the obscurer causes the observed drop in the covering fraction. Because of the higher soft X-ray continuum level, the September 2013 Chandra spectrum is the only X ray spectrum of the campaign in which individual features of the warm absorber could be detected. The spectrum shows absorption from Fe-UTA, O iv, and O v, consistent with belonging to the lower-ionization counterpart of the historical NGC 5548 warm absorber.

The main purpose of this work is to investigate the variability pattern(s) in a sample of optically selected Seyfert 2 galaxies. <BR /> Methods: We use the 26 Seyfert 2s in the Véron-Cetty and Véron catalog with data available from Chandra and/or XMM-Newton public archives at different epochs, with timescales ranging from a few hours to years. All the spectra of the same source were simultaneously fitted, and we let different parameters vary in the model. Whenever possible, short-term variations from the analysis of the light curves and/or long-term UV flux variations were studied. We divided the sample into Compton-thick and Compton-thin candidates to account for the degree of obscuration. When transitions between Compton-thick and thin were obtained for different observations of the same source, we classified it as a changing-look candidate. <BR /> Results: Short-term variability at X-rays was studied in ten cases, but variations are not found. From the 25 analyzed sources, 11 show long-term variations. Eight (out of 11) are Compton-thin, one (out of 12) is Compton-thick, and the two changing-look candidates are also variable. The main driver for the X-ray changes is related to the nuclear power (nine cases), while variations at soft energies or related to absorbers at hard X-rays are less common, and in many cases these variations are accompanied by variations in the nuclear continuum. At UV frequencies, only NGC 5194 (out of six sources) is variable, but the changes are not related to the nucleus. We report two changing-look candidates, MARK 273 and NGC 7319. <BR /> Conclusions: A constant reflection component located far away from the nucleus plus a variable nuclear continuum are able to explain most of our results.

For relaxed clusters, we found a positive correlation between the radio power of the BCGs and the strength of the cool core, consistent with previous studies on local samples. <BR /> Conclusions: Our study suggests that the radio loudness of the BCGs strongly depends on the cluster dynamics; their fraction is considerably higher in relaxed clusters.

We extended the analysed data from 1978 to 2014, by spanning 37 years, to verify whether a larger sample of data can be fitted with a quadratic term or a different scenario has to be considered. <BR /> Methods: We obtained 27 delays associated with the dip arrival times from data covering 37 years and used different models to fit the time delays with respect to a constant period model. <BR /> Results: We find that the quadratic form alone does not fit the data. The data are well fitted using a sinusoidal term plus a quadratic function or, alternatively, with a series of sinusoidal terms that can be associated with a modulation of the dip arrival times due to the presence of a third body that has an elliptical orbit.

In this work, we present the best sensitivity and angular resolution maps of the molecular disk and outflow of Mrk 231, as traced by CO(2-1) and (3-2) observations obtained with the IRAM/PdBI. In addition, we analyze archival deep Chandra and NuSTAR X-ray observations. We use this unprecedented combination of multi-wavelength data sets to constrain the physical properties of both the molecular disk and outflow, the presence of a highly-ionized ultra-fast nuclear wind, and their connection. The molecular CO(2-1) outflow has a size of  1 kpc, and extends in all directions around the nucleus, being more prominent along the south-west to north-east direction, suggesting a wide-angle biconical geometry.

This period saw A climbing out of a prolonged coronal X-ray minimum, as documented contemporaneously by Chandra, while B was rising to, then falling from, a peak of its long-term (̃8 year) starspot cycle. The FUV fluxes of the primary were steady over most of the STIS period, although the [Fe xii] λ1242 coronal forbidden line (T̃ 1.5 MK) partly mirrored the slowly rising X-ray fluxes. The FUV emissions of the secondary more closely tracked the rise and fall of its coronal luminosities, especially the “hot lines” Si iv, C iv, and N v (T̃ 0.8-2 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> K), and coronal [Fe xii] itself. The hot lines of both stars were systematically redshifted, relative to narrow chromospheric emissions, by several km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, showing little change in amplitude over the four-year period, especially for α Cen B, despite the significant evolution of its coronal activity. Further, the hot lines of both stars, individually and epoch-averaged, displayed non-Gaussian shapes, which most trivially could be decomposed into two components, one narrow (FWHM ̃25-45 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), the other broad (60-80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). A bimodal Gaussian strategy had been applied previously to the α Cen stars, but this was the first opportunity to evaluate any time dependence. In fact, not much variation of the component properties was seen, even over the major cycle changes of B. Curiously, the line fluxes were about equally divided between the narrow and broad components for both stars. The fact that there is minimal activity dependence of the narrow/broad flux partition, as well as densities derived from O iv] line ratios, either during the cycle evolution of B or between A and B, suggests that there is a dominant “quantum” of FUV surface activity that is relatively unchanged during the cycle, aside from the fractional area covered.","keyword":["binaries: visual","stars: individual: HD 128620","HD 128621","G191B2B","BD+28°4211","RR Tel","ultraviolet: stars"]}]}}

We constructed extinction-limited samples for five principal clusters and constructed K-band luminosity functions that we compare with those of artificial clusters with varying ages. This analysis provided mean ages and possible age spreads for the clusters. We found that IC 1795, the centermost cluster of the complex, still hosts a large fraction of young sources with circumstellar disks. This indicates that star formation was active in IC 1795 as recently as 2 Myr ago, simultaneous to the star-forming activity in the flanking embedded clusters, W3-Main and W3(OH). A comparison with carbon monoxide emission maps indicates strong velocity gradients in the gas clumps hosting W3-Main and W3(OH) and shows small receding clumps of gas at IC 1795, suggestive of rapid gas removal (faster than the T Tauri timescale) in the cluster-forming regions. We discuss one possible scenario for the progression of cluster formation in the W3 complex. We propose that early processes of gas collapse in the main structure of the complex could have defined the progression of cluster formation across the complex with relatively small age differences from one group to another.

We analyzed data sets from the three pointed observations made of this galaxy with Chandra along with a merged data set obtained from combining these data sets: the total effective exposure time of the merged data set is 63515 s.

It has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (SF) in their host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxy formation. Previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremely rare, high-power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on their hosts. Here we present detailed observations of the gas and dust continuum of NGC 1266 at millimeter wavelengths. Our observations show that molecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at \\dot{M}_out ≈ 110  M_☉ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, of which the vast majority cannot escape the nucleus. Only 2 M <SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is actually capable of escaping the galaxy. Most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars. The far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact (lsim 50 pc) source that could either be powered by an AGN or by an ultra-compact starburst. The ratio of the SF surface density (Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>) to the gas surface density (Σ _H_2) indicates that SF is suppressed by a factor of ≈50 compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is forming stars, and ≈150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if the central region is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. The AGN-driven bulk outflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering the fragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through a process of turbulent injection. This result suggests that even relatively common, low-power AGNs are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxies as their black holes grow onto the M-σ relation.","keyword":["galaxies: elliptical and lenticular","cD","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: individual: NGC 1266","galaxies: ISM","galaxies: nuclei","galaxies: star formation","molecular data","radio continuum: galaxies","submillimeter: galaxies","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

We found significant γ-ray variability in the former object. Overall, we note that the Suzaku spectra for both PKS 0625-354 and 3C 78 are rather soft, while the LAT spectra are unusually hard when compared with other γ-ray detected low-power (FR I) radio galaxies. We demonstrate that the constructed broadband spectral energy distributions of PKS 0625-354 and 3C 78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton model. The results of the modeling indicate lower bulk Lorentz factors compared to those typically found in other BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, but consistent with the values inferred from modeling other LAT-detected FR I radio galaxies.

We detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 ± 0.0001 and 3.7130 ± 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components: rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool, equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect nearly continuously. We present a spectral energy distribution of the blended system spanning more than 9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT 33370 AB will affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and temperatures potentially altered by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively.

The flux decline was particularly evident in fainter regions and the mean decline was 30%-40% in the 0.5-1.2 keV energy band. A typical expansion of the brightest part of the remnant was 1.″9, which corresponds to an expansion rate of 0.″14 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The soft X-ray spectra extracted from both the 2000 and 2013 data can be explained by a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model convolved with interstellar absorption, though do not allow us to constrain the origin of the flux evolution. The plasma temperature has not significantly evolved since the 2000 epoch and we conclude that the fading of the X-ray emission is due largely to expansion. This implies that recent expansion has been into a lower density medium, a scenario that is qualitatively consistent with the structure of the circumstellar environment photographed soon after the initial explosion more than a century ago. Fainter areas are fading more quickly than brighter areas, indicating that they are fainter because of a lower ambient medium density and consequently more rapid expansion.","keyword":["stars: individual: GK Persei nova Persei 1901","novae","cataclysmic variables","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The high Ni/Fe and Mn/Fe mass ratios (0.11-0.24 and 0.018-0.033, respectively) in the hot plasma component that dominates the K-shell emission lines indicate a degree of neutronization in the supernova ejecta that can only be achieved by electron capture in the dense cores of exploding WDs with a near-Chandrasekhar mass. This suggests a single-degenerate origin for 3C 397, since Chandrasekhar mass progenitors are expected naturally if the WD accretes mass slowly from a companion. Together with other results supporting the double-degenerate scenario, our work adds to the mounting evidence that both progenitor channels make a significant contribution to the SN Ia rate in star-forming galaxies.","keyword":["atomic data","infrared: ISM","ISM: individual objects: 3C 397","G41.1─0.3","ISM: supernova remnants","nuclear reactions","nucleosynthesis","abundances","X-rays: ISM","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The presence of a bar has no influence on the AGN strength, with barred and unbarred active galaxies showing equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions. From our results, we conclude that the occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of the large scale structure of a galaxy.

This interpretation lends support to the idea that the low-entropy, metal-rich gas of merging halos reaches the clusters’ centers, which explains observations of core-collapse supernova product metallicity peaks, and which is seen in hydrodynamical simulations. The gas in these merging halos would have to reach cluster centers without mixing in the outer regions. On the other hand, the metallicity dispersion does not change with mass in the outer regions of the clusters, suggesting that most of the outer metals originate from a source with a more uniform metallicity level, such as during pre-enrichment. We also measure a correlation between the metal content in low-mass clusters and the morphological disturbance of their intracluster medium, as measured by centroid shift. This suggests an alternative interpretation, whereby transitional metallicity boosts in the center of low-mass clusters account for the larger dispersion of their metallicities.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

Our observations therefore constrain the average spectral shape of galaxy-wide populations of luminous accreting binaries (i.e., ULXs). Interestingly, despite a completely different galaxy sample selection, emphasizing here a range of SFRs and stellar masses, these properties are similar to those of super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have been studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that NGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ≈3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other star-forming galaxies due to a corresponding overabundance of ULXs.

This suggests that the diffuse ISM does not contain a signicant presence of grains with {a}<SUB>{max</SUB>}\\gt 0.5 μm. (3) Most halos were best fit assuming a single dust cloud dominated the scattering, rather than smoothly distributed dust along the sightline. (4) Eight sources could not be fit with the models considered here, most of which were along distant (d\\gt 5 kpc) sight lines through the Galactic thin disk. (5) Some sight lines had halos with observed X-ray scattering optical depth τ<SUB>sca</SUB>/A<SUB>V</SUB> that were signicantly different than expected.

Since the fainter star, δ Ori Aa2, has a much lower X-ray luminosity than the brighter primary (δ Ori Aa1), δ Ori Aa provides a unique system with which to test the spatial distribution of the X-ray emitting gas around δ Ori Aa1 via occultation by the photosphere of, and wind cavity around, the X-ray dark secondary.

The companion papers discuss the X-ray variability seen in the Chandra spectra, present new space-based photometry and ground-based radial velocities obtained simultaneously with the X-ray data to better constrain the system parameters, and model the effects of X-rays on the optical and UV spectra. We find that the X-ray emission is dominated by embedded wind shock emission from star Aa1, with little contribution from the tertiary star Ab or the shocked gas produced by the collision of the wind of Aa1 against the surface of Aa2. We find a similar temperature distribution to previous X-ray spectrum analyses. We also show that the line half-widths are about 0.3-0.5 times the terminal velocity of the wind of star Aa1. We find a strong anti-correlation between line widths and the line excitation energy, which suggests that longer-wavelength, lower-temperature lines form farther out in the wind.

To search for the production site(s) of these flares, we conducted a multi-wavelength observing campaign using Keck, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. As the short timescales of the γ-ray flares (≲ 1 day) suggest a small emitting region, the Crab’s inner knot (about 0.6 arcsec from the pulsar) is a candidate site for such flaring. This paper describes observations of the inner knot, seeking to understand its nature and possible relationship with γ-ray flares. Using singular-value decomposition, analysis of the HST images yielded results consistent with traditional methods while substantially reducing some uncertainties. These analyses show that the knot’s intrinsic properties (especially size and brightness) are correlated with its (projected) separation from the pulsar. This characterization of the inner knot helps in constraining standard shock model parameters, under the assumption that the knot lies near the shocked surface. While the standard shock model gives good agreement in several respects, two puzzles persist: (a) the observed angular size of the knot relative to the pulsar-knot separation is much smaller than expected; and (b) the variable high degree of polarization (reported by others) is difficult to reconcile with a highly relativistic downstream flow. However, the IR-optical flux of the inner knot is marginally consistent with the shock accelerating most of the Nebula’s optical-emitting particles.","keyword":["ISM: jets and outflows","ISM: supernova remnants","pulsars: individual: Crab","techniques: image processing","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

We show that there are two X-ray point sources embedded in the diffuse emission of the LBA galaxy Haro 11. CXOU J003652.4-333316 (abbreviated to Haro 11 X-1) is an extremely luminous (L{}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}̃ {10}<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), spatially compact source with a hard-X-ray spectrum. We suggest that the X-ray emission from Haro 11 X-1 is dominated by a single accretion source. This might be an active galactic nucleus or a source similar to the extreme black hole binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates that Haro 11 X-1 may be a BHB in a low accretion state. In this case, the very high X-ray luminosity suggests an intermediate mass black hole that could be the seed for formation of a supermassive black hole. Source CXOU J003652.7-33331619.5 (abbreviated Haro 11 X-2) has an X-ray luminosity of {L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}̃ 5× {10}<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a soft X-ray spectrum (power-law photon index Γ ̃ 2.2). This strongly suggests that Haro 11 X-2 is an X-ray binary in the ultra luminous state (i.e., an Ultra Luminous X-ray source, ULX). Haro 11 X-2 is coincident with the star-forming knot that is the source of the Lyα emission. The association of a ULX with Lyα emission raises the possibility that strong winds from X-ray binaries play an important role in injecting mechanical power into the interstellar medium, thus blowing away neutral material from the starburst region and allowing the Lyα to escape. We suggest that feedback from X-ray binaries may play a significant role in allowing Lyα emission to escape from galaxies in the early universe.","keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: dwarf","galaxies: starburst","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

It is predicted that such high accretion rates should give rise to massive, radiatively driven winds. However, observational evidence of a wind, in the form of absorption or emission features, has remained elusive. As such, the reported detection of X-ray spectral residuals in XMM-Newton spectra of NGC 5408 X-1, which could be related to absorption in a wind is potentially very exciting. However, it has previously been assumed by several authors that these features simply originate from background diffuse plasma emission related to star formation in the ULX’s host galaxy. In this work we utilize the spatial resolving power of Chandra to test whether we can rule out this latter interpretation. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity in these spectral features is emitted from a highly localized region close to the ULX, and appears point-like even with Chandra. It is therefore highly likely that the spectral features are associated with the ULX itself, and little of the flux in this spectral component originates from spatially extended emission in the host galaxy. This may be consistent with the suggestion of absorption in an optically thin phase of a super-Eddington wind. Alternatively, we could be seeing emission from collisionally ionized material close to the black hole, but critically this would be difficult to reconcile with models where the source inclination largely determines the observed X-ray spectral and timing properties.","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","black hole physics","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The new type 1 AGN fraction shows much more complex behavior with respect to black hole mass and bolometric luminosity than has been suggested previously by the existing receding torus model. The type 1 AGN fraction is sensitive to both of these factors, and there seems to be a sweet spot (ridge) in the diagram of black hole mass and bolometric luminosity.

Our analysis shows that the thermal emission of 3C 400.2 can be well explained by a two-component non-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a high temperature (kT ≈ 3.9 keV) and supersolar abundances, while the other component has a much lower temperature (kT ≈ 0.14 keV), solar abundances and shows signs of overionization. The temperature structure, abundance values and density contrast between the different model components suggest that the hot component comes from ejecta plasma, while the cooler component has an interstellar matter origin. This provides the first evidence of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova remnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In addition, the non-equilibrium ionization plasma component associated with the ejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the cooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore, our data can most naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer parts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept-up high-density ambient medium, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low density of the plasma.

Our new spectral energy distribution (SED) includes the radio, near-infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands.

We apply a multizone jet model to the new broad-band SED, and we compare our results to previous fits to the same source using the same model at 4-5 decades higher luminosity. We find that after a BHXB transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state, the jet base becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler (by at least a factor of 2). Our preferred model fit indicates that jet particle acceleration is much weaker after the transition into quiescence. That is, accelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high enough Lorentz factors to contribute significant amounts of synchrotron X-ray emission. Instead, the X-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission from a population of mildly relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocity distribution that are associated with the jet base. The corresponding (thermal) synchrotron component from the jet base emits primarily in the infrared through ultraviolet wavebands. Our results on XTE J1118+480 are consistent with broad-band modelling for A0620-00 (the only other comparably low Eddington ratio BHXB with a well-sampled SED) and for Sgr A* (the quiescent supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre). The above could therefore represent a canonical baseline geometry for accreting black holes in quiescence. We conclude with suggestions for future studies to further investigate the above scenario.","keyword":["acceleration of particles","accretion","accretion discs","stars: individual: XTE J1118+480","ISM: jets and outflows","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

Spectral fitting of neutron star atmosphere models to the thermal component is one of the leading methods for measuring the neutron star radius. However, it has been known for years that the X-ray spectra of quiescent neutron stars vary between observations. While most quiescent variability is explained through a variable power-law component, the brightest and best-studied object, Cen X-4, requires a change in the thermal component and such thermal variability could be a problem for measuring neutron star radii.

Therefore, the results are inconclusive and we cannot exclude or require thermal variability in that source.

Under the predictions of this model, we use a follow-up X-ray observation of one of these transients, SN 2012hn, to place weak upper limits on the detonator mass of this system that include all intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs).

We herein present a deep Suzaku observation of an S0 galaxy NGC 5866, which is relatively rich in molecular gas as an S0 galaxy and shows significant evidence of cool-hot gas interaction.

This abundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among the highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies.

An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that NGC 5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total amount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature increases from inner to outer haloes, with the inner region has a temperature of ̃ 0.25 keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating.

We demonstrate that the latter is essential for unbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity function evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z = 3-4 and z = 4-5. There is also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity dependent. The space density of AGN with L<SUB>X</SUB>(2-10 keV) 〈 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>- 1</SUP> drops by a factor of 5 between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN appears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of ultraviolet (UV)/optical selected quasi-stellar objects at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright luminosities, L<SUB>X</SUB>(2-10 keV) 〉 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>- 1</SUP>. At fainter luminosities X-ray surveys measure higher AGN space densities. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity functions, however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that the Type I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z 〉 3, opposite to trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN in keeping the hydrogen ionized at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function yields ionizing photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the Universe ionized at redshift z 〉 4. A source of uncertainty in this calculation is the escape fraction of UV photons for X-ray selected AGN.","keyword":["galaxies: active","quasars: general","galaxies: Seyfert","X-rays: diffuse background","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"]}]}}

The components seem to be in the form of a stratified wind with several layers intersected by our line of sight. Assuming that the changes in the WA are solely due to ionization or recombination processes in response to variations in the ionizing flux among the different observations, we are able to estimate lower limits on the density of the absorbing gas, finding that the farthest components are less dense and have a lower ionization. These limits are used to put stringent upper limits on the distance of the WA components from the central ionizing source, with the lowest ionization phases at several pc distances (〈50, 〈20, and 〈5 pc, respectively), while the intermediately ionized components lie at pc-scale distances from the center (〈3.6 and 〈2.2 pc, respectively). The highest ionization component is located at ~0.6 pc or closer to the AGN central engine. The mass outflow rate summed over all WA components is ~0.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, about six times the nominal accretion rate of the source. The total kinetic luminosity injected into the surrounding medium is a small fraction (~0.03%) of the bolometric luminosity of the source.

Weakening accretion shocks and the presence of unresolved cool gas clumps, both of which are expected to correlate with large-scale structure filaments, have been invoked to explain these results. In the outskirts of A1750, we find entropy profiles that are consistent with self-similar expectations, and gas fractions that are consistent with the mean cosmic value, both along and perpendicular to the putative large-scale filament. Thus, we find no evidence for gas clumping in the outskirts of A1750, in either direction.

Several studies have shown clear evidence that the IR emission in these objects is powered by a highly dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) that shows close to Compton-thick absorption at X-ray wavelengths. Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host galaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with those of a normal galaxy. Here we discuss a sub-population of eight Hot DOGs that show enhanced rest-frame UV/optical emission. We discuss three scenarios that might explain the excess UV emission: (i) unobscured light leaked from the AGN by reflection over the dust or by partial coverage of the accretion disk; (ii) a second unobscured AGN in the system; or (iii) a luminous young starburst. X-ray observations can help discriminate between these scenarios.

The X-ray spectrum is consistent with a single, hyper-luminous, highly absorbed AGN, and is strongly inconsistent with the presence of a secondary unobscured AGN. Based on this, we argue that the excess blue emission in this object is most likely either due to reflection or a co-eval starburst.

Based on the radio through X-ray spectrum of the jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of the counterjet, we argue that inverse-Compton models can be conclusively rejected, and propose that the X-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission from particles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. For the first time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is also time-varying in X-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in the hotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. The new data allow us to confirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with the predictions of an inverse-Compton model and we show that the data favour models in which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result of spatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniform electron distribution.","keyword":["galaxies: individual: Pictor A","galaxies: jets","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The cluster contains multiple high-metallicity regions with sharp edges.

Around the western cold front are a series of ̃7 kpc `notches', suggestive of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to close to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity blobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity, also explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity profile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1.9-kpc-radius inner shell-like structure and a weak 1.1-1.4 Mach number shock around the central cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are nine depressions in surface brightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The shocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5-10 Myr time-scales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling.

The exact nature of the progenitors and the relative importance of these processes are still open questions. One relatively unexplored method to constrain the progenitors is to search for high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) at SN locations in pre-explosion X-ray observations. In an HMXB, one star has already exploded as a core-collapse SN, producing a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole. It is likely that the second star in the system will also explode as an SN, which should cause a detectable long-term change in the system's X-ray luminosity. In particular, a pre-explosion detection of an HMXB coincident with an SN could be informative about the progenitor's nature. In this paper, we analyse pre-explosion ACIS observations of 18 nearby Type Ib, Ic and IIb SNe from the Chandra X-ray observatory public archive. Two sources that could potentially be associated with the SN are identified in the sample. Additionally we make similar post-explosion measurements for 46 SNe. Although our modelling indicates that progenitor systems with compact binary companions are probably quite rare, studies of this type can in the future provide more stringent constraints as the number of discovered nearby SNe and suitable pre-explosion X-ray data are both increasing.","keyword":["binaries: close","stars: evolution","supernovae: general","supernovae: individual: SN 2004gt","stars: Wolf-Rayet","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

However, the dust-scattering component is not included in the current absorption models: phabs, TBabs, and TBnew. We simulate a large number of Chandra spectra to explore the bias in the spectral fit and N<SUB>H</SUB> measurements obtained without including extinction from dust scattering. We find that without incorporating dust scattering, the measured N<SUB>H</SUB> will be too large by a baseline level of 25 per cent. This effect is modulated by the imaging resolution of the telescope, because some amount of unresolved scattered light will be captured within the aperture used to extract point source information. In high-resolution spectroscopy, dust scattering significantly enhances the total extinction optical depth and the shape of the photoelectric absorption edges. We focus in particular on the Fe-L edge at 0.7 keV, showing that the total extinction template fits well to the high-resolution spectrum of three X-ray binaries from the Chandra archive: GX 9+9, XTE J1817-330, and Cyg X-1. In cases where dust is intrinsic to the source, a covering factor based on the angular extent of the dusty material must be applied to the extinction curve, regardless of angular imaging resolution. This approach will be particularly relevant for dust in quasar absorption line systems and might constrain clump sizes in active galactic nuclei.","keyword":["scattering","dust","extinction","quasars: absorption lines","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: ISM","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"]}]}}

The entropies within 01r<SUB>200</SUB> (S<SUB>0.1r200</SUB>) of FSs are systematically lower than those inordinary galaxy groups, which is consistent with previous reports, but we find their S<SUB>0.1r200</SUB> - T relation is more similar to galaxy clusters. The derived mass profiles of FSs are consistent with the Navarro, Frenk and White model in (0.1 - 1)r<SUB>200</SUB>, and the relation between scale radius r<SUB>s</SUB> and characteristic mass density δ<SUB>c</SUB> indicates self-similarity of dark matter halos of FSs. The ranges of r<SUB>s</SUB> and δ<SUB>c</SUB> for FSs are also close to those of galaxy clusters. Therefore, FSs share more common characteristics with galaxy clusters.
